Based on a number of quantitative and qualitative studies, populations are estimated to be depleted and have declined by more than 60-90% in at least 50% of its range, as there is some refuge in deeper waters, and is considered&#160;over exploited&#160;in at least 40% of it range although exact declines are difficult to estimate. The status of populations in Australia are considered stable, as it is not collected here. Declines and over-exploitation have occurred primarily since the 1960s, and although generation length is not known, echinoderms are not considered to go through senescence and therefore may be greater than several decades. At present, global declines are therefore estimated to be between 30-40% based on estimates of depletion and&#160;over exploitation&#160;across its range. This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable. However, better and more quantitative data are need to better estimate the impact of fishing on this species.

Based on a number of quantitative and qualitative studies, populations are estimated to have declined by 80-90% in at least 50% of its range, and are considered overexploited in at least 30% of its range although exact declines are difficult to estimate. Declines and overexploitation have occurred primarily since the 1960s, and although generation length is not known, echinoderms are not considered to go through senescence and therefore may be greater than several decades. Additionally, this species may be more vulnerable to overfishing given its low fecundity and late sexual maturation. This species is therefore listed as Endangered. However, better and more quantitative data are needed to better estimate the impact of fishing on this species.","This species is found along slopes and passes within reef zones (Skewes <em>et al.</em> 2004) and along outer reef flats (Conand and Mangion 2002) to depths of 35 m, but is more common in waters from 10-20 m. It is a large, conspicuous species, with relatively lower fecundity and relatively low weight gonads and sexual maturity, making it more vulnerable to overfishing (Conand 1998).<br/><br/>They are distributed mainly in shallow coral reef areas, on reef flats, reef slopes and near passes on sandy or hard bottoms with large rubble and coral patches.

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category, however due to the susceptibility of bleaching events this species is listed as Near Threatened. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments.

The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. However, this is an encrusting species that is probably not significantly harvested.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is an uncommon species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).

These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread,  uncommon throughout its range, found in deeper waters, and exhibits fast recovery and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 21% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical and subtropical reef environments. It is found mostly on upper and mid reef slopes. This species is found to at least 30 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures.

Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern.

However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a wide range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is very widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments.

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

3765052,133479,Acropora hyacinthus,Near Threatened,,2008,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most important known threat for this species is extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to bleaching and disease and is collected for the aquarium trade, therefore it is listed as Near Threatened. Because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found on upper reef slopes and outer reef flats, intertidally on reef flats, and subtidally on reef edges, slopes and submerged reefs (Wallace 1999).This species is considered to be a main reef-framework builder and is found at 4-10 m on the Chagos lagoon (Sheppard 1982). <em>Acropora hyacinthus</em> likely spawns annually in October in French Polynesia. (Carroll <em>et al</em>. 2006) This species is found from 5-20 m.<br/><br/>General genus information: throughout its range, <em>Acropora</em> can be found on any stretch of reef and is often the dominant coral, especially along the reef front. Staghorn and plate forms flourish in sheltered areas, whereas clusters and semi-massive types can withstand more exposed conditions. Species that occur from the reef top to the reef slope become gradually more flattened with depth (Wood 1983).","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. This species exhibited very high bleaching levels and high mortality approaching 100% in the 1998 bleaching event in Palau (Brunno <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five different diseases recorded for this species (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). This is particularly susceptible to COTS, disease, and physical disturbances (Richards and Aeby pers. comm.). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 19908. Indonesia is the largest exporter with an annual quota of 13,750 live pieces in 2005. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002).  In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is one of the most abundant corals of exposed outer reef slopes of much of the western Pacific. It was found at six of six regions in Indonesia (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2001).  Found at 40 sites of 87 sites surveyed in the Marshall Islands (Richards pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years. Therefore any population decline rates for the Red List assessment are measured over at least 30 years.&#160;<strong>See the supplementary material&#160;for further details on population decline and generation length estimates</strong>.",Decreasing,"This species is found in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the south-west and north-west Indian Ocean, the Arabian/Iranian Gulf, the northern Indian Ocean, the central Indo-Pacific, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan and the East China Sea, the oceanic west Pacific, the central Pacific, and Johnston Atoll.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

10566196,41880,Haliotis cracherodii,Critically Endangered,A4e,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>H. cracherodii</em> began supporting a commercial fishery in California in 1968. In the mid 1980s a wasting disease, Withering Syndrome, began to appear, reducing the commercial catch considerably. At present, the harvest of black abalone is illegal in California, but the species is still harvested commercially in Mexico. At most surveyed locations where the disease was present, black abalone populations were reduced by more than 80%. Fishers on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island made the first observation of this disease in 1985. It has since spread throughout all the California Channel Islands and northwards to Monterey. In Mexico, cases of Withering Syndrome have been reported as far south as Cedros Island in Baja California. The spread of the disease now extends over almost the entire range of the species.

Withering Syndrome does not appear to showing any signs of relenting in its progression along the coast in either direction. The strong correlation between adult abundance and recruitment suggests that larvae do not disperse very far from their point of origin, thus depleted abalone populations are unlikely to be restored by recruitment from distant populations. 

If no action is taken,  it is estimated that <em>H. cracherodii</em> will decline by at least 80% over a period of three generations (from approximately 1975 to 2015), extending into the past and the future, and consequently, the species qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A4.","<em>H. cracherodii</em> is a sessile marine gastropod. It clamps tightly to rocky substrates and feeds on algal matter scraped from the rock surface. Gametes are released into the water where fertilization occurs to produce free-swimming larvae. Successful fertilization requires aggregated adults and synchronized gonad development and release (McShane 1996). After approximately 15 days as non-feeding zooplankton, the larvae metamorphose into their adult form, develop a shell, and settle onto a hard substrate (Douros 1985). Juveniles mainly reside in rocky crevices and feed primarily on benthic diatoms, bacterial films and algae found on coralline algal substrate (NMFS 2000). As juveniles, abalone are vulnerable to predators which graze the surfaces of coralline algae and associated species (McShane 1989). As they increase in size they become less vulnerable to predation and are able to emerge from their sheltered habitat and search out more desirable food sources (NMFS 2000). Adult abalone depend primarily on drift algae (Tegner and Dayton 1987). Main predators of adult abalone are fishes, otters and humans.
<br/>
<br/>Most black abalone are found in the intertidal zone, ranging from the high tide line to a depth of up to five meters (Lindberg 1989).
<br/>
<br/>Generation time is not easy to determine. Individuals do not display the same growth rate and older individuals may cease to grow altogether (B. Tissot, Washington University, pers comm.). Reproductive maturity is reached between three and seven years (when They are re approximately 130-150 mm in length), but life expectancy ranges from 25 to 75 years. Taking an average of these provides only a very rough estimate for the average age of parents, especially since the relationship between age and fecundity is unknown. Nonetheless, generation time is estimated to be between 14 and 41 years, thus a minimum three generation period would be 42 years (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001).","Withering Syndrome (WS) is the main threat to black abalone. It is manifested by epipodial discoloration, loss of appetite, severe weight loss and atrophy of the foot muscle. As a consequence, abalone lose their ability to adhere to the substratum and eventually die (Tissot 1991, Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1992). The first reports of WS were in black abalone were made by fishers on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island (Lafferty and Kuris 1993). The disease then spread throughout all the Californian Channel Islands from 1985 to 1992, except Santa Catalina Island, where no studies have been conducted (Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1992, Lafferty and Kuris 1993, Van Blaricom <em>et al.</em> 1993). At most surveyed locations black abalone were initially reduced to less than 20% of their initial densities (Tissot 1990, Davis <em>et al.</em> 1992, Richards and Davis 1993, Altstatt <em>et al.</em> 1996). Some have completely lost their black abalone populations (P. Hakker pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>Black abalone are also affected by the large human population inhabiting southern California, the majority of which reside within 50 km of the coast (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992). Coastal development, such as residential areas, harbours and coastal access points and large ocean discharges of municipal and industrial wastes contribute to the degradation  and loss of near shore habitat (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992).  Commercial and recreational fishing have also placed black abalone populations under intense pressure. The large decline in fisheries landings may have been a consequence of over harvesting (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992), however the mass mortality of populations in the Channel Islands that began in 1985 has been attributed to WS and continued fishing (Haaker <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/> <br/>Other possible threats to the species include storm, competition with other marine organisms and predation (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001).","Large-scale commercial fishery of black abalone began in California in 1968 (Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1995). Like most other abalone fisheries, black abalone landings underwent a rapid rise, peaking in 1973 at a maximum catch of over 800 metric tonnes, followed by a decline (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992). In 1992, commercial landings had diminished to 17.4 metric tonnes, as a wasting disease, Withering Syndrome (WS) spread throughout southern California (Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1992, Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1995).",Decreasing,"The black abalone, <em>Haliotis cracherodii</em>, is found in intertidal waters off California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico.",,Marine,"All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game. The restrictions employed can range from minimum legal size limits and bag limits  to harvest seasons and closures (Breen 1989, P. Haaker pers. comm.). The harvest of black abalone is currently illegal in California.
<br/>
<br/>In Mexico, green abalone, <em>H. fulgens</em> and pink abalone <em>H. corugata</em> are the main focus of commercial fishery. Black abalone do not form a large proportion of total abalone landings. Exclusive rights to abalone exploitation were granted to cooperative fishers' organizations. Although new legislation in 1992 allowed for the entry of the private sector into the fishery, all abalone harvesting is still done by cooperatives (Ramande-Villanueva <em>et al.</em> 1998). Total allowable catches per cooperative (TACCs) were introduced in 1973, but their criteria have changed appreciably over the years (Ramande-Villanueva <em>et al.</em> 1998). Since black abalone make up such a small proportion of the commercial catch in Mexico, it is difficult to assess the impact of these regulations on the species.
<br/>
<br/>In January 1999 the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) published its updated list of candidate species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Black abalone was one of 14 new species added to the list (NMFS 1999). The NMFS intends to conduct a review to determine whether black abalone deserves a national listing of endangered or threatened (P. Haaker, pers. comm.).  Listing as a candidate species does not, however, provide substantive or procedural protection for the species under the ESA (NMFS 1999).
<br/>
<br/>Stock restoration by transplantation from distant populations has been proposed to restore depleted populations (Tissot 1997). Smith <em>et al.</em> (2001) propose that both American and Mexican fishery authorities work together to develop a re-stocking program to help restore black abalone populations all along the coast, especially in key locations such as the Channel Islands. Since the greatest threat facing the black abalone is disease, special precaution must be taken to ensure that the transplantation of adult abalone does not create a new path for the spread of WS. 
<br/>
<br/>While not an especially charismatic species, many living in coastal California and Baja California recognize that the black abalone is important to local economies. A well designed public education campaign may result in a successful appeal for public funding (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001). 
<br/>
<br/>There is a need to survey areas where the  status of black abalone populations are currently unknown, namely the coastline between Los Angeles and central Baja California, in addition to new surveys being carried out at sites previously examined. A study of withered black abalone at the northern fringe of WS's current range (Monterey and San Francisco) (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001).
<br/>
<br/>Perhaps most importantly, further investigation of WS itself is also needed (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001), including investigation into whether WS is caused by an introduced pathogen, identification of other species that may serve as reservoir hosts, and identification of resistant individuals for potential brood stock and development of husbandry.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 21% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004).

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to bleaching and disease and is collected for the aquarium trade, therefore it is listed as Near Threatened. Because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found in shallow reef environments, especially upper reef slopes and outer reef flats. It is also found subtidally on reef edges and walls (Wallace 1999). This species is found from 2-15 m. <br/><br/><em>Acropora secale</em> likely spawns annually in September and October in French Polynesia (Carroll <em>et al</em>. 2006).","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). One record of disease for this species (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2005). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/><em>Acropora</em> species are in the top three genera collected for the aquarium trade. This species is known in the aquarium trade (Delbeek pers. comm.). The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 4,198.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is common in the Pacific, but it is uncommon in the Indian Ocean.

However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004).

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in tropical, shallow reef environments. This species is found on the back and foreslope of the reef and in lagoons. This species is found to 20 m. <br/><br/>Species in this genus may be overlooked because of their low growth profile and the relatively small colony size (seldom exceeding 25 cm in diameter) (Wood 1983).","In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is an uncommon species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments on upper reef slopes. This species is found to at least 20 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats in shallow to mid depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.

However, it is particularly susceptible to bleaching, crown-of-thorns starfish predation, and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 36% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A4ce. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species occurs in most shallow, tropical reef environments. This species is found to at least 20 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Staghorn and plate forms flourish in sheltered areas, whereas clusters and semi-massive types can withstand more exposed conditions. Species that occur from the reef top to the reef slope become gradually more flattened with depth (Wood 1983).","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover.

Nevertheless, Zapata and Vargas-Ángel (2003) suggest that it is unclear whether the 1982-83 El Niño event drove <em>A. valida</em> to extinction in the Eastern Tropical Pacific because the colonies at Gorgona Island had a normal appearance when they were found in September 1983 (i.e., towards the end of the warming episode) by Prahl and Mejia.<br/><br/>Other threats: presumably climate change.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987).

54232897,133303,Acropora lutkeni,Near Threatened,,2014,2008-01-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most important known threat for this species is extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 21% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to bleaching and disease and is collected for the aquarium trade, therefore it is listed as Near Threatened. Because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments on upper reef slopes exposed to strong wave action or currents. It is also found subtidally on reef edge to about 5 m depth and on submerged reefs (Wallace 1999). <em>Acropora lutkeni</em> likely spawns annually in October in French Polynesia (Carroll <em>et al</em>. 2006). This species is found from 3-12 m.","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is sometimes common on the Great Barrier Reef, it is usually uncommon elsewhere.

This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 21% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found most on reef foreslopes. This species is found to at least 25 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is widespread, and occurs across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 65.

However, it is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, crown-of-thorns starfish predation, and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 37% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A4ce. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found on upper reef slopes, especially those exposed to wave action or currents. It is found in shallow reef top and reef edge habitats often filling in spaces between other <em>Acropora</em> species (Wallace 1999). This species is found from 2-15 m.","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/><em>Acropora</em> species are in the top three genera collected for the aquarium trade. It is known to occur in the aquarium trade (Delbeek pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is very widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found on upper and mid reef slopes and in lagoons. This species is found to at least 30 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is widespread, and occurs across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 4,646. Indonesia is the largest exporter with an annual quota of 1,700 live pieces in 2005. In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. However, this is an encrusting to sub-massive species that is probably not significantly impacted by harvest.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is uncommon.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

54307611,133700,Montipora hoffmeisteri,Least Concern,,2014,2008-01-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most important known threat for this species is extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.",This species occurs in shallow and deeper tropical reef environments. It is found in most reef environments. This species is found to at least 40 m.,"The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. However, this is an encrusting species that is probably not significantly harvested.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is common, but inconspicuous.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years. Therefore any population decline rates for the Red List assessment are measured over at least 30 years.&#160;<strong>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for further details on population decline and generation length estimates</strong>.",Decreasing,"This species is found in Eastern Africa, Seychelles, Chagos Archipelago, Thailand, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, China, South China Sea, Japan, Papua New Guinea, northern half of Australia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Palau, Mariana Islands, Osagawara Island (Japan), Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Cook Islands, and French Polynesia.",,Marine,"All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

178341498,178290276,Pycnopodia helianthoides,Critically Endangered,A2ace,2020,2020-08-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> has experienced dramatic decreases in population size and range after enduring a global disease outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS). From 2013-2017, <em>Pycnopodia </em>and other sea star species were devastated by SSWS, which affected a variety of sea star species across more than 5,000 km of the western coast of North America (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2019; Menge <em>et al. </em>2016; Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016; Miner <em>et al.</em> 2018; Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2019; Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019). Prior to 2013, <em>Pycnopodia </em>was regularly found in a variety of shallow marine habitats from the Pacific Coast of Baja California, Mexico to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States. It is a non-harvested, generalist species and had few major threats prior to the disease outbreak.&#160;<br/><br/>After the rapid loss of <em>Pycnopodia </em>to SSWS from 2013-2017, we compiled 31 datasets including 61,043 surveys that showed that <em>Pycnopodia </em>population size declined by 90.6% from its historic to its current population size. Additionally, the area of occupancy has declined 57.6% from 4,052 km² before the outbreak (2003-2012) to 1,716 km² afterward. The species is now extremely rare across much of the outer coast of the contiguous United States and Mexico, a swath of 2500 km of coastline. Since the initial outbreak subsided around 2016-17, <em>Pycnopodia</em> populations have not begun to recover, are still declining in many regions, and have reached near-zero densities along the outer coasts of the contiguous United States and Mexico. Further, there is evidence that the disease is still present in remaining populations, and warming water from global climate change seems to contribute to disease severity.&#160;<br/><br/>The decline of this predatory sea star species may have ecosystem-wide implications. Evidence in some locales suggests that the loss of predatory <em>Pycnopodia </em>on rocky reefs can substantially reduce their predation on sea urchins, allowing urchins populations to grow and overgraze kelp. Kelp are the foundational species in kelp forest ecosystems and provide habitat and food to many organisms, including those in important fisheries (e.g. abalone, rockfish). However, it is not yet known whether the role of <em>Pycnopodia </em>as a sea urchin predator is a key driver of kelp forest health in North America or whether their role is important only under certain circumstances. In places where <em>Pycnopodia </em>does benefit kelp, the recovery of <em>Pycnopodia </em>may be a valuable management tool for maintaining healthy kelp forest ecosystems in the future.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Pycnopodia </em>meets the qualification for Critically Endangered under Criterion A2ace on the basis of its 90.6% global decline. Additionally, it qualifies for Vulnerable under Criterion B2ab as its current area of occupancy is less than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, its number of locations could be as low as 1, and there is evidence for continuing population declines. <em>Pycnopodia</em> qualifies as Least Concern under Criteria C and D, and Data Deficient under Criterion E. For further details see the Supplementary Materials.","<strong>Habitats<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>appears to be a habitat generalist, occurring on many different types of marine habitats including mud, sand, shell, gravel, rocky bottoms, kelp forests, and the lower rocky intertidal (Fisher 1928, Mauzey <em>et al.</em> 1968, Lambert 2000). Previous work on <em>Pycnopodia </em>has shown variable associations with one or another habitat types depending on life stage and region (Shivji <em>et al.</em> 1983). Our analysis of habitat preferences showed that no clear associations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>with particular habitat or substrate types in California (see Supplementary Material: Data Analysis: Depth and Habitat Patterns for more information). Because of this finding, we did not incorporate habitat type into our population estimates.&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Depths<br/></strong>Previous sources have identified the depth range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>to be from 0 - 435 m (0 - 1427 ft) and typically no more than 120 m (394 ft) (Fisher 1928, Lambert 2000, Hemery <em>et al. </em>2016). In our global analysis, we found that <em>Pycnopodia </em>was most abundant before the sea star wasting syndrome outbreak in shallow nearshore waters less than 25 m (82 ft), less abundant in middle depths 25 m to 50 m (164 ft), and present but rare to depths up to 300 m (Mean ± SD: 39,077 ± 226,556 km<sup>-2</sup>, 1,996 ± 5,573 km<sup>-2</sup>, and 204 ± 740 km<sup>-2</sup>, respectively). The large standard deviations in these averages are because <em>Pycnopodia </em>tends to be patchily distributed. <em>Pycnopodia </em>was very rare below 300 m depth, with only 12 records. The deepest record was 455 m (1493 ft), though it is possible that this and other deep records were actually misidentified <em>Rathbunaster californicus</em>, a species that looks similar and extends deeper. The upper depth range extends into the low intertidal zone to around 0 m above mean lower low water, especially along the Alaskan coast (Konar<em> et al.</em> 2019). Regarding depth preferences in shallower waters within the range of SCUBA (&lt;30 m or &lt;100 ft), no pattern in densities (Bonaviri<em> et al.</em> 2017) nor sizes (Shivji <em>et al. </em>1983) with depth have been noted in the literature. We also detected no pattern in densities within this shallower range (up to 25 m).<br/><strong><br/>Environmental Range<br/></strong>The large geographic range of this species indicates it can inhabit a wide variety of environments. Along the Oregon coast, correlations between <em>Pycnopodia </em>distributions and environmental conditions suggest that their abundances are driven most strongly by annual mean daily water temperature (peak at 9-11.5 °C), depth (peak at 0 to 75m) and annual mean daily salinity (peak at 33.0-33.4 PSU), in that order (Hemery<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160; Within the 12-16°C gradient in mean annual water temperature along the Channel Islands, California, <em>Pycnopodia </em>was more abundant at the cooler western islands (San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands) than the warmer eastern islands (Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands), and 14°C seemed to be strong cutoff driving abundance (Bonaviri <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet and Ecological Role<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>is a generalist and opportunistic predator that consumes a large number of prey taxa including but not limited to gastropods, echinoderms, and crustaceans (Supp. Fig. 6; Mauzey<em> et al. </em>1968, Herrlinger 1983, Beas-Luna <em>et al. </em>2014). <em>Pycnopodia </em>is usually considered a macroinvertivore since the bulk of its prey fit this category. Preferred prey items vary due to local abundance, climate, latitude, and habitat gradients. For example, Mytilus trossulus (formerly M. edulis) has been reported to be a favorite prey item in the Gulf of Alaska (Paul and Feder 1975), gastropods in British Columbia (Shivji<em> et al.</em> 1983), sea urchins in northern California (Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019) and gastropods and crustaceans in central California (Herrlinger 1983). Interestingly, very few species feed on <em>Pycnopodia </em>(Supp. Fig. 6; Mauzey <em>et al.</em> 1968).<br/><br/>As a generalist predator, <em>Pycnopodia </em>can regulate the structure of nearshore benthic communities and are considered a keystone predator in some areas across its distribution (Duggins 1983, Herrlinger 1983). <em>Pycnopodia </em>preys on sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. droebachiensis, and Mesocentrotus franciscanus) and can create small, urchin-free zones through direct predation or by causing sea urchin “stampedes” (Paine and Vadas 1969, Duggins 1983, Watson and Estes 2011). Since sea urchins feed on kelp (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera, and Nereocystis luetkeana) the short-term existence of prey-free patches can influence algal diversity, community primary productivity, and kelp forest community structure (Paine and Vadas 1969, Dayton 1975, Duggins 1983, Herrlinger 1983). Since the SSWS outbreak began in 2013, several papers have identified further evidence of the potential ecological role <em>Pycnopodia </em>can play in kelp forest ecosystems. The loss of this predator was associated with a 311% increase in the abundance of medium-sized urchins and a 30% decline in kelp densities in British Columbia, suggesting <em>Pycnopodia </em>exerts top-down control over urchin populations (Burt <em>et al. </em>2018). A similar phenomenon has been observed in southern British Columbia, Northern California, and southern California (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre<em> et al.</em> 2020). The potential for <em>Pycnopodia </em>to play a role in regulating kelp forest community structure and dynamics may be strongest in regions lacking other sea urchin predators, such as otters.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Life History and Reproduction<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>has separate sexes and broadcast spawn to produce free-swimming, feeding, pelagic larvae (Greer 1962, Morris<em> et al.</em> 1980). The larvae develop for 50-146 days before settling and metamorphosing (Strathmann 1978, J. Hodin pers. comm. 2020). Beyond this basic information, little is understood about the reproductive ecology, growth rates, physiology, and longevity of <em>Pycnopodia</em>. They exhibit indeterminate growth and have not been individually tagged successfully nor reared in captivity from birth through adulthood, so determining lifespan and growth rates is challenging. We interviewed aquarists and larval ecologists, gathered size distribution data and used models to estimate the generation time for <em>Pycnopodia</em>. We found generation time to be in the range of 20.5 – 65 years, with the middle-most estimates providing a narrower range of 27 – 37 years range (Supp. Figs. 7 and 8 and Supp. Table 6). For more information on reproduction, life history, and generation time modeling, see Supplementary Materials: Habitats and Ecology: Life History and Ecology &amp; Determination of Generation Time.","<strong>Disease<br/></strong>Without question, disease is currently the greatest threat to <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations. This global analysis and many published works (Hewson<em> et al. </em>2014, Montecino-Latorre <em>et al. </em>2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Burt <em>et al.</em> 2018, Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2019, Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020) demonstrate that this species’ precipitous decline corresponds to the outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome in 2013-2017. Though the global outbreak appears to have subsided, localized outbreaks continue to occur in <em>Pycnopodia </em>and other sea star species. The pathogen or agent that causes SSWS remains unknown (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019). While disease is the proximate threat, there is also evidence that climate change in the form of increasing temperatures exacerbates or may have triggered the disease (see Climate Change below). It is imperative that we understand disease etiology and dynamics in coordination with any attempts to mitigate disease effects or aid <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery. For more information see Supplementary Material: Threats.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Climate Change&#160;<br/></strong>There is evidence that warmer temperatures speed the progression and increase mortality from SSWS in the laboratory (Eisenlord <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kohl <em>et al.</em> 2016). Anomalously warm water temperature has been associated with region-specific timing of SSWS outbreaks in <em>Pycnopodia </em>(Eisenlord <em>et al.</em> 2016, Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019, Aalto <em>et al.</em> 2020). Understanding the mechanistic relationship between temperature and SSWS will help to understand the continued risks for <em>Pycnopodia </em>and inform recovery efforts. For more on the interaction of climate change and SSWS threats, please see the Supplementary Material: Threats.&#160;<br/><br/>It also is likely that warming waters with global climate change may directly decrease <em>Pycnopodia </em>densities. Along the Oregon coast, Hemery <em>et al.</em> (2016) found strong effects of temperature, with peak abundances occurring at 9–11.5°C. Similarly, in Southern California warmer water temperature was associated with decreasing density of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, and 14°C seemed to be a strong cutoff driving abundance (Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overall, it is possible that ocean warming from human-caused climate change could drive decreases in <em>Pycnopodia </em>density in surviving populations or prohibit recovery.<br/><br/><strong>Fishing and Trade<br/></strong>While bycatch of <em>Pycnopodia </em>occurs in multiple fisheries (i.e. trap, seine, and trawl), more information is needed to determine whether this is a threat to <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations. Similarly, we do not know whether dried <em>Pycnopodia </em>traded by online retailers represents a threat. Finally, there are anecdotal observations that refuge populations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in the fjords of British Columbia may be disrupted by the practice of “log dumping”, where timber is felled into the fjords before transport (T. Blaine, pers. comm.). The threat this poses to these refuge populations is unknown. When population sizes of <em>Pycnopodia</em> are large, it is unlikely that any of these external sources of mortality from fishing and trade pose a substantial threat to the species. However, these activities could hinder population recovery in areas with severely reduced population sizes. Further investigation of these potential threats is needed.","<strong>Historical Abundance<br/></strong>Literature on <em>Pycnopodia</em> abundance before the 2013–2017 sea star wasting disease outbreak suggests that they were fairly common throughout their range. These include studies from Alaska, United States (Duggins 1983, Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019), British Columbia, Canada (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Burt<em> et al.</em> 2018), Oregon, United States (Hemery <em>et al.</em> 2016), and California, United States (Herrlinger 1983, Eckert 2007, Rassweiler <em>et al. </em>2010, Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020). The most geographically comprehensive study was done by Harvell <em>et al. </em>(2019) from Alaska to California. For details on each of these studies, please see the Supplementary Material: <em>Pycnopodia </em>Populations in the Literature.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>The Outbreak of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome<br/></strong>Many of the studies referenced above detail the recent declines in <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations caused by the outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) that began in 2013 (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017, Burt <em>et al.</em> 2018, Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019, Konar <em>et al. </em>2019, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020). Harvell <em>et al. </em>(2019) showed a 100% decline in Oregon and California and a 99.2% decline in Washington due to SSWS. SSWS is the largest marine epizootic on record (Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019) and affected over 20 species of sea stars (Hewson <em>et al. </em>2014). <em>Pycnopodia </em>was especially vulnerable (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al. </em>2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016) because it was the most susceptible of the sea star taxa affected by the multi-host SSWS pathogen (Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019). SSWS was first observed in the Olympic Coast of Washington in June 2013 followed by Central California and the Salish Sea in summer 2013. It quickly expanded south to Mexico and slowly northward, arriving in the Aleutian Islands by 2016. While the cause of SSWS is unclear (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2018), it causes lesions, arm loss, and ultimately death within days to weeks, and very few individuals recover once symptoms appear (Hewson <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/><strong>Estimating Population Sizes over Time<br/></strong>We assessed the global population of <em>Pycnopodia</em> using 31 datasets (Supp. Fig.1 and Supp. Table 1) from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska to the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. These included 61,043 surveys spanning from 1967 to 2020 and distributed from the rocky intertidal to the bathyal plain at 984m deep. Since the <em>Pycnopodia </em>decline followed an abrupt non-linear pattern (Supp. Fig. 2), we elected to compare the population decline before versus after sea star wasting syndrome (see Supplementary Material for more detail on this timeline). To estimate global population trends (Supp. Fig. 3), we first the estimated seafloor surface area among regions and depths to quantify available habitat (Supp. Tables 2 and 3). We then determined how densities (1987-2019) of <em>Pycnopodia </em>varied by region, depth, and outbreak phase (Supp. Fig. 4 and Supp.&#160; Tables 2 and 5). We then multiplied density by habitat area to calculate the estimated population size before and after the SSWS outbreak (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). For further details on these methods, please refer to Supplementary Material: Population Data and Methods for IUCN Assessment.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Global Decline<br/></strong>Our global analysis confirms the declines caused by sea star wasting syndrome documented in many of the studies above. Indeed, many of the datasets in the references above were included in our global analyses. We calculated a 90.6% global decline in <em>Pycnopodia </em>population size when comparing before (1987-2013) to after (2014, 2015 or 2017-2019, depending on the region) the SSWS outbreak (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). The decline extended to all depths, with a 92.9% decline in deep depths (&gt;25m) and a 93.8% decline in shallow depths (&lt;25m) (Supp. Table 2). The global post-decline population estimate is 594,251,528 (average between 2014/2015/2017 and 2019, depending on timing of the decline in each region). However, the global estimate for 2019 is 80,627,721.<br/><br/><strong>Region-Specific Declines&#160;<br/></strong>Among regions in shallow waters (where the vast majority of animals are found), the most severe declines occurred in the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the outer coast of the western continental United States, where the decline ranged from 97.2% - 99.8% (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). Severe declines also occurred in many northern regions, including a 91.9% decline in the Salish Sea, a 94.7% decline in southeast Alaska, and a 94.9% decline in the eastern Gulf of Alaska.<br/><br/>The western Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands showed more moderate population declines (61.1% decline, Supp. Table 2), and observations by contributors suggest the disease was less severe in these regions (B. Konar, pers. comm. 2020). However, sparse observations make these estimates uncertain (Supp. Table 2; N = 7 surveys after the SSWS-induced decline). We present two estimates of decline for the north, central and coastal British Columbian coast. The first compares before and after the Aug 1 2015 pre-/post-crash cutoff (matches analysis use for other regions) and indicates a moderate decline (67.4%). However, we believe this number is an underestimate because it incorporates the data from juvenile animals that recruited to Calvert Island, British Columbia shortly after SSWS. This population then experienced a second decline in 2018, presumably due to another SSWS outbreak, and most did not reach adult size (A. Gehman pers. obs. 2020). We were not able to separate these juveniles from adults, so we narrowed our post-decline population estimate using data from 2018-2019 only, when the second outbreak had subsided and the remaining animals were generally nearing adult size. Using this method, we estimated that the decline in this region was 89.9% (Supp. Table 2).<br/><br/><strong>Continued Declines<br/></strong>The remaining populations are primarily in the northern half of the species’ previous range and are patchily-distributed populations in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska, north, central and coastal British Columbia, and the Salish Sea (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). Very few animals remain along the outer coast of the United States and Mexico (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2).&#160;Importantly, there is little indication that <em>Pycnopodia </em>is in the process of recovering from the outbreak (Supp. Fig. 5 and Supp. Table 4). Indeed, most regions with remaining populations, including much of Alaska and British Columbia (including the Salish Sea), have exhibited continuing declines since 2017. Regions on the outer coast of the contiguous United States and Mexico, have “flat lined” at extremely low densities (Supp. Fig. 5; Washington outer coast, Oregon, North, Central, Southern and Baja California). <em>Pycnopodia </em>is now very rare along this &gt; 2500 km stretch of coastline, and seem to be decreasing. Notably, in all of the United States and Mexican contiguous outer coast, only 20 of 3976 total surveys recorded an animal between 2018-2019, with only 7 in California, and most of these were lone individuals. No animals have been recorded in Baja California since 2015, and none in California in 2019 (Supp. Table 4).",Decreasing,"<strong>Range Description<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> is commonly found in marine waters ranging from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States to San Diego, California, United States (Herrlinger 1983). However, this global analysis shows that the historical southern limit of <em>Pycnopodia </em>extends to Isla Natividad, Baja California, Mexico (27.84501°N, 115.1428°W). From there, it used to be common northward throughout the Pacific coastline of North America. Our northernmost observation is in Bettles Bay near Anchorage Alaska, United States (60.95496°N, 148.29942°W). From our data, it also extends westward along the Aleutian Island chain to the Fox Islands near Nikolski, Alaska (52.63844°N, 169.1337°W), and researchers have observed it as far west as Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, in the Andreanof Islands in 2006 (S. Jewett pers. comm. 2020). Other than a single, and perhaps misidentified, observation near St. George Island, Alaska (56.67678°N, 169.5519°W), the species does not appear to extend into the Bering Sea.<br/><br/><strong>Depth Range<br/></strong>Our analysis and historical records show that the depth range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>is from 0 to 455 m (0–1,493 ft) with the highest abundance between 0 and 25 m deep. They are rare deeper than 120 m (394 ft) (Fisher 1928, Lambert 2000, Hemery <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Number of Locations<br/></strong>The primary threat to <em>Pycnopodia</em> is sea star wasting syndrome, which appears to have caused declines in all populations globally within three years. Thus, the minimum number of locations (defined by IUCN as a geographically or ecologically distinct area in which a single threatening process can rapidly affect all occurrences of an ecosystem type) could be as low as 1. However, considering the species’ broad geographic range and the finding that populations in the northwestern edge of its range may have been less affected by the disease, the number of locations may be as high as 10.","No targeted fisheries exist for <em>Pycnopodia</em>. Although most regions allow recreational harvest of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, the harvest rate is likely extremely low. However, <em>Pycnopodia </em>is routinely encountered as bycatch in bottom-contacted pot and trap fisheries as well as trawl and seine fisheries (Supp. Figs. 9 and 10). The encounter rate and survival rate as bycatch is unclear. They are difficult to disentangle without injury, so handling may decrease survival. There is no evidence that this species is widely traded as a live animal in the aquarium trade. Their large size and predatory behavior probably deter nearly all aquarists. Although not pervasive, dried “sunflower sea stars” are commercially sold individually online as decor. For details, see the Supplementary Material: Use and Trade.",Marine,"<strong>Determining the Cause of SSWS<br/></strong>The cause of SSWS is an essential question that should be answered before we can determine the advisability of <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery efforts. The persistence of SSWS, especially in other species, may potentially negate or greatly reduce the efficacy of any <em>Pycnopodia </em>captive rearing and reintroduction efforts outlined below. Further, we have no diagnostic test for SSWS to ensure that sea stars that we may introduce to the wild are not a danger to wild <em>Pycnopodia </em>or to other sea stars.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Captive Rearing and Reintroduction<br/></strong>Captive rearing is the most viable recovery option for locales with few or no <em>Pycnopodia </em>that are far from surviving populations (i.e. the outer Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico). While this conservation action does not address the underlying threats to <em>Pycnopodia </em>(disease and climate change), it can be used to restore populations in suitable areas that may not otherwise recover on their own. Drawing from aquaculture practices, captive rearing of <em>Pycnopodia </em>has the potential for cost-effective high production on a relatively quick timescale. Captive rearing efforts could provide a reservoir of individuals to maintain genetic diversity, maintain population numbers, and aid in the recovery of the species. Further, captive rearing programs can have the simultaneous benefit of being scientific resources to study SSWS and to gather information on the life history and environmental niche of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, which could aid subsequent recovery efforts. To this end, the Nature Conservancy and the University of Washington have collaborated to begin the captive rearing of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, have demonstrated its feasibility, and have accumulated valuable life history information (e.g., growth rates, environmental conditions, diets) that will inform future conservation actions.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reducing Lethal Take<br/></strong>While we assume direct harvest is relatively low (see Use and Trade), even a small amount of take in this critically endangered species can hinder recovery. Currently, there are few protections against harvest of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in most regions and we have little information on harvest statistics. Enacting specific regulations that disallow the targeted harvest of <em>Pycnopodia </em>could reduce this source of mortality, which could be particularly important for small, remnant populations.<br/><br/>Reducing bycatch, particularly in trap fisheries, is an additional potential conservation action to aid recovery of <em>Pycnopodia</em>. Since the threat posed by bycatch to <em>Pycnopodia </em>is unclear (see Use and Trade and Threats), the first conservation action should be to determine its magnitude. If bycatch indeed can cause decline or hinder recovery (particularly in vulnerable populations), public engagement with the recreational and commercial fleets about best practices for catch and release would be a logical next step.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Localized Protections<br/></strong>The recovery of isolated or sparse populations of adult <em>Pycnopodia </em>or the success of new recruitment events may also benefit from locally focused protection from take or disturbance. For example, one of the few surviving populations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in the contiguous United States occurs in Hood Canal, Washington, where bycatch from the local crab fishery could have a negative impact on persistence or recovery. Similarly, there are surviving populations in the fjords of Central British Columbia (T. Blaine pers. comm. 2020) where the practice of&#160; “log dumping” (felling or storing trees in the marine environment for later transport), could have detrimental effects on those populations. Some localized, and perhaps temporary, protections against human activity for these survivors may aid local recovery. Further, there is modest evidence that juvenile <em>Pycnopodia </em>utilize nearshore seagrass beds as a nursery habitat (A. Gehman and M. Miner pers. obs. 2020). Seagrass beds are highly susceptible to habitat degradation (Orth <em>et al.</em> 2006) so protecting these habitats may aid <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery. Finally, the recovery of this species in severely affected areas is contingent on recruitment from remote source populations. Since recruitment of <em>Pycnopodia </em>is often episodic and mortality of juveniles quite high (Sewell and Watson 1993), the success of a recruitment event may hinge on the local rates of mortality from human activities like fishing and habitat destruction.&#160;<br/><br/>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) may also serve as a viable, but less targeted, conservation action. While the spatially explicit protection afforded by MPAs does not necessarily protect <em>Pycnopodia </em>from its two most important threats, SSWS and climate change, MPAs can mitigate harvest, pollution, and habitat degradation. Multiple MPAs already exist in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and comprise ~1.55% of the range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>(5,377,374 km<sup>2</sup>; see Supplemental Material: Conservation Actions for details on these MPAs). These MPAs could also serve as target areas for the restoration and re-establishment of <em>Pycnopodia </em>by affording space-based protections during recovery. (see Supplemental Material: Conservation Actions and https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UM662HazRfvtnCrXdUJAszUn6jv0Ok-Yj5XiHETU30/edit?usp=sharing for details on these MPAs).","",,false,false,Global
