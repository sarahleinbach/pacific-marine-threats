931625,162627,Sepia apama,Near Threatened,,2012,2009-03-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sepia apama </span>has been assessed as Near Threatened. Intense fishing in one location has resulted in  massive local population declines. Although this has had limited impact  across the species range, it is coupled with the potential (but not  evidence/occurrence so far) for intense localized fishing elsewhere,  albeit on smaller aggregations. Because the species is short-lived (one to two years) and semelparous, the impact of such fishing would likely be catastrophic and we therefore consider this species Near Threatened (as it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A3d). We believe that a population reduction of greater than 20% may occur in the future based on existing exploitation of the largest known breeding aggregation and potential future exploitation of other smaller breeding aggregations elsewhere along the coast. If the population in the upper Spencer Gulf is shown to be a separate species then the Spencer Gulf species would be assessed as Endangered.","This species is a neritic species that occurs in a variety of habitats including: coral reefs, rocky reefs, seagrass beds and muddy and sandy areas (Norman 2003). They are active by day preying on fish and crustaceans (Norman 2003, Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). During breeding, ritualized visual displays are observed (Norman 2003). After mating the large eggs are laid in crevices and take three to five months to hatch at low temperatures (12°C) (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). The distribution of this species may be restricted to cool southern waters because low temperatures reduce the problems associated with gas exchange in large eggs (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). The young develop directly (Norman 2003). The adults are preyed upon by dolphins, particularly during the spawning season (Norman 2003) and albatrosses (H. Battam pers. comm.). They appear to spawn in aggregations based on suitable habitat for egg laying.","Ocean acidification caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the   atmosphere is potentially a threat to all cuttlefish. Studies have   shown that under high pCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, cuttlefishes actually lay   down a denser cuttlebone which is likely to negatively affect buoyancy   regulation (Gutowska <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). This species is the target of commercial fisheries (e.g. Spencer Gulf, Norman 2003), which have reduced population size by 57% in the Spencer Gulf. It is also taken by hook-and-line or spear fishing and as bycatch off southern Australia (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). The Spencer Gulf population is additionally suffering from threats imposed by a proposed desalination plant development at Point Lowly. This may lead to high levels of salinity in Spencer Gulf, higher temperatures, increased turbidity levels, decreased oxygen levels and possibly the discharge of contaminants, which would likely reduce the Spencer Gulf population even further. Unpublished data suggest from the Geelong  area suggest a two  year pre-breeding harvest could eliminate the whole population. Local fisherman report that in March-April <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. apama</span> embark on  a pre-breeding feeding frenzy. They attack hooked fish and are detached  with much difficult when brought to the surface. Within this period, they would appear to be extremely vulnerable to fishing. Hence, the greatest threat to this species is probably intense localised fisheries on breeding aggregations (albeit smaller than the Spencer Gulf aggregation) around the coast.","The population size of this species is unknown. Estimates of abundance and biomass at the spawning aggregation area in northern Spencer Gulf, South Australia show a 57% decline between 2001 and 2008 (Hall 2008) and this is assumed to be the result of intense fishing activity in this area. This spawning aggregation, which is easily detected by divers and exploited by fishers, is associated with  the  physical features of the Gulf itself. Compared with the open  coast, the water is relatively sheltered and the Gulf has plenty of  hard substrate providing good attachment sites for eggs. The only other subpopulation for which information is available is Wollongong. The information from this area is anecdotal and comes from albatross researchers (the albatross feed on the spawning aggregations of cuttlefish). In the Wollongong region, aggregations also appear to be dependent on the availability of suitable habitat. The <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. apama</span> seaward distribution boundary appears to be determined by  water depth, and is estimated at about 75 metres. The coastal strip between  Red Point (Pt Kembla) and Austinmer appears to be the area where <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. apama</span> is most concentrated (total area 70-80 m²). It is suspected that this is due to the nature of the sea bottom, as this  area has numerous reefs, which are not typical of the sea floor to the  north and south of the region. The number of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. apama</span> carcasses and bones observed at sea does vary from  year to year, but a maximum estimate is several thousand (cumulative  annual total). Smaller concentrations of<span style=""font-style: italic;""> S. apama</span>  occur at other locations, including Sussex Inlet and Ulladulla, which  are south of Wollongong. It is unknown what proportion of the total population  the Spencer Gulf breeding aggregation represents but, in terms of area, the  Spencer Gulf IMCRA province encompasses about 15 % of the total shelf  provinces inhabited by <em>S. apama</em>.&#160; Hence, if the population size elsewhere has remained stable, and the breeding aggregation in Spencer Gulf is only drawn from Spencer Gulf,  then the total population decline to date is equivalent to about 8.5 %.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Australia (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). Its range stretches across southern Australia to Pointes Cloates in Western Australia to Shoalwater Bay in Queensland (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). It is also found around Lord Howe and Norfolk Island (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005).","This species is collected as bycatch as well as by hook-and-line, and spear fisheries along the southern Australia coast (Reid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). It has been actively targeted since the mid 1990s. The fishery in the Upper Spencer Gulf is of particular concern. There is also concern that smaller aggregations (such as that found at Wollongong) might be fished in the future.",Marine,"Recent fishing activity targeting the mass spawning aggregations at Spencer Gulf caused a decline in numbers leading to a temporary closure of the fishing grounds (Norman 2003). These mass spawning areas are easily accessible and could be used as tourist attraction (Norman 2003). Further research is recommended to determine the population trends, distribution, life history traits and threats impacting this species.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
953097,162917,Opisthoteuthis mero,Endangered,A2b,2014,2014-08-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Opisthoteuthis mero</em> has been assessed as Endangered. Data used to compile the New Zealand Red List (Freeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) provide estimates of a population decline of 50-70%, assumed to have occurred over a ten year period (two generations), due to fishing activity aimed at other deep water species. Assuming constant decline, declines over three generations would not exceed 60-80%.&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis&#160;mero </em>is only known from New Zealand waters. &#160;Only a single specimen has been seen in bycatch in  recent years<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>.&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Urgent research is required to establish the current population size and trends in the population size. These declines in population may not be reversible because of the low fecundity of the species.","Currently this species is known only from soft substrates. Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that all members of Opisthoteuthidae are primarily benthic. Most specimens have been collected from bottom trawls. Use of such gear is biased towards soft sediments; consequently, it remains unclear whether the species itself is biased towards soft sediments (Collins and Villanueva 2006).&#160;Cirrate octopods have several characteristics likely to make them rather slow to recover from population declines: longevity, slow growth and low fecundity. Embryonic development time has been estimated to range between 1.4 years and 2.6 years in three cirrate species based on models that incorporate egg size and water temperature, the shorter time being for a relatively shallow water species in warmer waters (Collins and Villanueva 2006). Studies of reproduction suggest a prolonged spawning period (with growth continuing during spawning) and eggs released one or two at a time (assumed because there are only ever one or two eggs in the distal oviduct). Eggs are thought to be laid singly on the sea floor and not brooded. Estimates of mean fecundity have been around 1,500 oocytes suggesting spawning may extend over multiple years, once reproductive maturity is reached. Difficulties of ageing cirrate octopods mean that no estimates for life span or generation length&#160;have been published, although Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that given the above factors, and the low metabolic rates of cephalopods in cold deep waters, the life cycle takes many years.","The genus&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis</em>&#160;is the most shallow genus of cirrate octopods and is therefore the genus most affected directly by commercial deep-water trawling. Other cirrates inhabit generally greater depths, else their maximum depth is at least deeper and below the capacity of trawlers. In addition, unlike other cirrates, the behaviour and mode of life of the genus&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis</em>&#160;is charaterized by a close association to the benthos (i.e., they are not pelagic or benthopelagic as other cirrates), making them more accessible and/or catchable by bottom trawling nets and therefore more vulnerable to deep-water trawling activities. Prior to 1998, when this species was formally described, this species was commonly found as bycatch in the scampi fishery in the Bay of Plenty and around the Auckland Islands. Many squid and octopus are retained as fisheries bycatch, trawled and discarded dead at sea. Species with low fecundity such as cirrate octopods may be particularly vulnerable to fisheries. Freeman&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;(2010) listed this species as 'Nationally Vulnerable' in New Zealand. The data they used to categorize this species suggested that it has been lost from areas exposed to trawling.","<em><strong></strong></em>This species is known from over 100 specimens and was at one point considered to be the most common opisthoteuthid in New Zealand waters (O'Shea <em>et al</em>. 2003).<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;</span>It was particularly common as a bycatch species from the scampi fishery in the Bay of Plenty and around the Auckland Islands and was also abundant on the Wairarapa coast and Chatham Rise. It is now considered to be locally extinct in places exposed to trawling (only a single specimen has been seen in bycatch in recent years), although Freeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2010) believe it likely that the species persists elsewhere. The overall population size is reported to have declined by 50-70% (Freeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). The assumed time frame for this decline is a 10 year period from the time of its formal description in 1999. Hence the decline occurred over less than three generations (assuming a&#160;conservative estimate of generation time of about five years based on a prolonged egg development period and an extended spawning period following an initial period of growth to maturity).",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> The species is known from waters virtually all around New Zealand (O'Shea <em>et al</em>. 2003). It occurs at depths of 360–1,000 m (Collins and Villanueva 2006).","This species is not utilised, but it is captured and discarded by commercial bottom-trawl fisheries through much of its range.",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place.

964020,163017,Heterololigo bleekeri,Least Concern,,2019,2015-07-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The spear squid <em>Heterololigo bleekeri&#160;</em>is assessed as Least Concern, because although stocks are well below their pre-exploitation levels, catches (as a proxy for abundance) have been relative stable at around 5,000 tons for at least the last 10 years. Annual stock assessments are conducted for this species, and it is essential that active management occurs which takes into account climate regimes as southern stocks are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation when warmer waters move northwards.","This demersal species occurs over the continental shelf in 0-150 m water depth, although its distribution is pushed deeper and further offshore where it overlaps with another loliginid squid species, <em>Photololigo edulis </em>(Jereb <em>et al.</em> 2010). Eggs of the spear squid are found in clusters of capsules, each capsule typically containing 50-100 eggs and measuring 5-14 cm by 0.5-1 cm, attached to algae, rocks or artificial hard substrates on the sea floor in depths usually of 20-30 m; occasionally, capsules occur as deep as 70 m. Females lay several batches of eggs (Beag <em>et al.</em> 1993, Iwata <em>et al.</em> 2005), laying as many as 2,000 eggs in total (Jereb <em>et al.</em> 2010). Egg development time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 21 days at 22°&#160;C to 83 days at 10°C, with optimum water temperature and salinity at 12.2°C and 36.0 psu respectively (Arkhipkin <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160; Newly hatched paralarvae are about 6.5 mm total length and spend a short period in the plankton before becoming demersal like adults.<br/><br/>Males mature earlier than females and attain larger sizes. Mature individuals can be found from 10 cm mantle length (ML) (males) and 13 cm ML (females) and all individuals are mature by 25 cm ML (males) and 20 cm ML (females). The maximum size recorded is 38 cm ML (males) and 30 cm ML (females), although lengths of 20-25 cm ML are more common.&#160;Around Japan, adult squid seem to migrate according to water temperature (preferring temperatures from 7-15°C) to spawn and spawning season varies by location. The main spawning season is in winter in the southern region and in spring in the northern region. Spear squid spawn through winter to spring in the south-western Sea of Japan (Arkhipkin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;Major shifts in abundance have also been linked to water temperature and climate shifts (Tian <em>et al</em>. 2013). The spear squid has a typical loliginid diet, feeding on copepods early in its life history, progressing to other small crustaceans and eventually to fish and squid. Life span has been determined as between 350 and 380 days (Jereb <em>et al.</em> 2010).","Fishing and climate change, in particular water temperature variation, appear to be the major threats to this species. A shifting water temperature regime negatively affects abundance of this species in the southern part of its range as warmer waters make northward incursions. The impact of fishing is less clear, but remains a potential threat&#160;(Tian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).","The population of this species has declined from around 15,000 tons in the late 1970s to around 5,000 tons in 2010 (Tian 2009,&#160;Tian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Catch declines in the south Japan Sea and the south Pacific fishing areas around Japan have been much greater than in the north Japan Sea and north Pacific fishing areas.This has been attributed to environmental forcing, with climate change bringing warmer waters increasingly further northward (Tian <em>et al.</em> 2013). Total spear squid landings from Japanese waters have&#160;have been fluctuating around the 5,000 ton mark since around 2000&#160;(Tian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).",Decreasing,"This species is often reported as endemic to Japan, where it occurs from surface waters to depths of 150 m. However, its distribution is more extensive (e.g. Jereb <em>et al.</em> 2010, Okutani 2005) and it is likely also distributed throughout the&#160;Yellow Sea, East China Sea (Zou <em>et al</em>. 2010, Lu <em>et al</em>. 2012), South China Sea, Taiwan Strait (Lu <em>et al</em>. 2012), around the east and west coasts of the&#160;Democratic People's Republic of&#160;Korea and the Republic of Korea (Okutani 2005). A single specimen was reported as far north as&#160;Primorsky Krai (Russian Federation) (Shevtsov 1996). This species&#160;inhabits deeper waters in the south where waters are warmer, and is found at shallower depths in the colder waters of the northern part of its distribution.&#160;It is caught in water depths of 70-300 m in Tosa Bay, Kochi Prefecture&#160;(Arkhipkin&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Abundances are decreasing in the East China Sea and the southern Japan Sea, related to recent high temperatures in these areas, and feeding areas are shifting to the northern waters such as the Sea of Okhotsk and northeastern Pacific waters (Y. Sakurai 2015, pers. comm.).","<p>The spear squid has been fished extensively&#160;in Japan. It is caught by bottom trawl, set nets, trap nets, jigging, hand-held dip nets, gill nets and blanket nets (Jereb <em>et al.</em> 2010). Like many loliginids, the spear squid forms dense inshore spawning aggregations which are easily targeted by fishers (Iwata <em>et al.</em> 2010). There are four separate fishing areas: southern Sea of Japan, northern Sea of Japan, southern Pacific (i.e., Pacific coast of southern Japan) and northern Pacific (i.e., Pacific coast of norther Japan). Fishing methods vary between regions. The dominant fishing methods are paired trawlers in the southern Sea of Japan and southern Pacific, single trawlers in the northern Pacific, and set-net fisheries in the northern Sea of Japan. There is periodicity in the catch abundances which reflects climate regime (Tian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The impact of fishing on stocks is less clear (Tian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), although fishing in unfavourable climate regimes may impact stocks and management should take account of this (Tian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Arkhipkin <em>et al.</em> 2015). Stock assessments are made annually by the Japanese government stock assessment programme, and are based on CPUE and landings trends.</p>",Marine,"Management measures have been considered in Japan, including closures of some areas to fishery and construction of artificial spawning beds to increase spawning yield and to create a favourable environment for newly hatched squid. It has been shown that most harvested spear squid have not spawned and research is required on migration and reproduction to facilitate development of management strategies that enable sufficient reproductive escapement&#160;(Iwata <em>et al. </em>2010). Stock management is required throughout the range of this species, and to facilitate this research is required into the species' distribution, life history and ecology and level of harvesting throughout its range. Understanding of the interactions of fishing pressure and environmental variables is required to develop a stock-specific management strategy for the southern stocks in order to facilitate their recovery (see Arkhipkin <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Tian (2009) and Tian <em>et al.</em> (2013) recommend a delay to the onset of the fishing season to protect young squid, and a ban on fishing on the spawning grounds at peak spawning times (Arkhipkin <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Based on a number of quantitative and qualitative studies, populations are estimated to have declined by more than 90% in at least 50% of its range, and are considered overexploited in at least 30% of its range, although exact declines are difficult to estimate. The status of populations in China are not known, and populations near mainland Australia are targeted but not considered to be overexploited. Declines and overexploitation have occurred primarily since the 1960s, and although generation length is not known, echinoderms are not considered to go through senescence and therefore one generation length may be greater than several decades. As this species is estimated to have experienced at least a 50% decline over the past 30-50 years, it is therefore listed as Endangered. If fishing pressure was significantly decreased, this species may recover relatively quickly due to its reproductive capacity.","<p>This species is distributed mainly in low energy  environments behind fringing reefs or within protected bays and shores.  Individuals prefer ordinary coastal areas to coral reefs, particularly  intertidal seagrass beds close to mangroves, however they are also found  along inner reef flats and lagoons. This species is attracted to muddy  sand or mud habitats (Rasolofonirina pers. comm. 2010, Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004).  Juveniles of this species settle in shallow seagrass beds and some may make it to deeper waters (Mercier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999). This species has been found to preferentially settle on seagrass such as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Thallassia hemprichi</span> (Hamel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2001). Recent studies on released juveniles have shown that  mangrove/seagrass areas were the most suitable habitat for settling  juveniles, due mainly to low predation rates (Dance <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003, Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2004). This species is also known to burrow, possibly leading to biased transect data.</p><p>In the Western Central Pacific, this species can be found in inner reef flats of fringing reefs and lagoon islets between 0 and 15 m (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).&#160; In Viet Nam, it is found in sandy estuaries or lagoons between 2 and 25 m (Choo 2008). In the Africa and Indian Ocean region, this species can be found in the back reef over muddy sand between 0 and 5 m, in the vicinity of mangroves; both adults and juveniles burrow in the sand (Conand 2008). In Madagascar, it can be found in the inner slope and seagrass beds, with highest densities in the latter (Conand 2008). This species has narrow habitat preferences that restrict it's range within the Torres Straight and the surrounding areas of Australia (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004).</p>      <p>In the Western Central Pacific, reproductive biology studies have been conducted by several authors, yielding the following information on reproductive periods: Great Barrier Reef (Australia) between November and January, Great Barrier Reef (Australia) November and December, Northern Territory (Australia) between December and February; New Caledonia December to January and August to September; PNG in November and December; Solomon Islands from September to December (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In India, only a careful microscopic revision of the gametes allows identification of a specimen as male or female (James 2004). In Asian countries near the Equator, this species spawns throughout the year. However, in Indonesia, it had two peak spawning periods, whilst in the Philippines, the main spawning event is from May to June and October to November (Choo 2008). In Australia, this species seems to follow a pattern of spawning in  warmer months, but also undergoes a smaller, secondary peak of spawning  later in the year (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004).</p>    <p></p><p>Larvae of this species are planctonic, small juveniles under 10 mm in  length that are epibiontic (live on seagrasses) and juveniles and adults  are endobiontic. This species grows relatively fast when young, reaching size at first maturity at ca. 180 g in a year (Conand 1989, Purcell 2010). Shelley (1985) estimated that it grows 14 g/month. In the Philippines, size at first maturity is 120 g (Gamboa pers. comm. 2010). In captivity, this species has reached settling stage after 13-16 days as planktonic larvae (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). This species is reported to mature and to grow to 15 cm in one to two years (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). This species recruits well under proper conditions.<br/></p><p>In general, generation length is unknown for these species. Body size is not a good indicator of age or longevity. There is some indication, however, that many echinoderms do not go through senescence, but simply regenerate. Therefore generation length cannot be estimated, but is assumed to be greater than several decades (20-40 years) in a natural, undisturbed environment.<br/></p>","Commercial harvest is of high concern for this highly valued species (Toral-Granda 2006, 2007). This species is one of the most valuable species of holothurian and  it is intensively exploited in many tropical  countries for trade in the Asian markets (Rasolofonirina pers. comm. 2010). Despite being a high value species, this species showed an increase in catches after the decline in catch of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga miliaris</span> as seen in Fiji (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). This species has been heavily exploited in many parts of its range, and is also a bycatch of prawn nets in Madagascar (Toral-Granda 2007). Although few individuals are found in field surveys, they are still one of the most targeted species by fishers (Purcell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).","<p>Genetic studies on this species show distinct populations within  Australia (the Northern Territory, the Torres Strait, the Solomon  Islands, the Great Barrier Reef), the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia  with little geneflow (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Genetic studies involving this species have showed a very restricted  gene flow indicating a limited recruitment from within regions (Uthicke  and Benzie 2001, Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004).</p><p>This species has been significantly depleted in at least 50% of its range (e.g. in East  Africa, Madagascar, India, Viet Nam, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands)&#160;  It is considered overexploited in at least another 25% of its range (e.g.  Philippines and Indonesia), and the status of populations that have been heavily targeted in China are not  known (Chen 2004, Li 2004). In New Caledonia, India and Malaysia catches have been depleted (Hamel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001), In the Torres Strait, the fishery for this species was closed in the  mid 1990s, and the current biomass today is still estimated at less than  8 percent of the virgin biomass (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000). This species may also be overexploited in  Vanuatu as the fishery has been closed since 2008. In Australia, this  species is targeted in the Northern Territory, but is not considered to  be overexploited, except possibly in the Torres Strait.&#160; <br/></p><p>Depletion  refers to commercially unviable, and estimated to represent an  approximately 90% loss or greater over the past 25-50 years (since the 1960s). In areas where it is considered  overexploited, populations are difficult to estimate based on regional  and local fishing effort, but harvests have declined and based on  traditional fisheries definitions, overexploited is estimated to be 30%  above maximum sustainable yield. This species has been reported to be  extirpated from a few locations in recent years (in Egypt see Hasan  2005; parts of Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam and Malaysia see Choo 2008;  Papua New Guinea Milne Bay see Skewes <em>et al</em>. 2002; and some parts of Solomon Islands  see Friedman <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;</p><p><strong>Regional and Country Specific Information:</strong><br/></p><p>In the Solomon Islands, this species is considered rare. In Samoa, the little information available on sea cucumber densities showed the absence of this species. In Palau, recorded densities of this species in 2003 were 40 ind/ha. In Vanuatu, there were 43 ind/ha in 1987, however recent surveys show lower densities in certain sites. In Fiji, there were 625 ind/ha in 1993, while in 2003 there were only 160 ind/ha<sup> </sup>in areas close to Suva (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Also in Fiji, catches for this species peaked at 700 t in 1988, and stocks are now considered depleted (Bruckner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2003).</p><p>In New Caledonia, information suggests some overharvesting. In New Caledonia, populations of a few commercial species appear depleted, namely <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Holothuria fuscogilva</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Holothuria</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> lessoni</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga lecanora</span>. Several other species are perhaps not critically low but are relatively sparse, namely <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinpyga mauritiana</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. miliaris</span> and this species (Purcell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Furthermore, although few of this species are found in field surveys, they are still  one of the most common species collected by fishers (Purcell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). In New Caledonia, exports were over 125 t in 1990 and 1991 with declines to less than 81 t/yr from 1992 to 1994 (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. miliaris</span>  harvest ~75% of exports; this species harvest ~ 25% of exports).  Exports continued to decline from 79.8 t in 1994 to 39.1 t in 1998  (Bruckner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003).</p><p>Recent information from Papua New Guinea indicates that this species has been overexploited. In  New Ireland Province, the fishery for this species targets all sizes. In the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, this species formed 100% of  the sea cucumber catch in 1990 and 1991, and dropped only because of  depleted stocks (Lokani pers. obs.). Catches in Papua New Guinea dropped from  192,647 kg/year in 1991 to 39,302 kg/year in 1993.<br/><br/>In Torres Strait (Australia), 1996 surveys showed suppressed stocks of this species and only small individuals, and a further survey in 1998 confirmed these results. This species is considered over-exploited in Torres Straight, fully exploited in the Northern Territories, and unexploited in Queensland waters (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2004). In Torres Strait, 1000 t of this species were harvested in 1995, and populations collapsed and the fishery for this species stopped (Bruckner  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003). Other surveys done in 2000, 2002 and 2004 have shown only a very slow recovery of this species (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).</p>      <p>Many tropical countries in the Indo-Pacific are targeting sea cucumbers  with this species being the main overfished species (Choo 2008). In Indonesia (Sulawesi), this species is considered overfished and in other locations it is a rare species. In Malaysia, it is now rare and fishing pressure is focusing on other lower value species. In Thailand, its population has also become depleted. In Viet Nam, this species is fast approaching local extinction. In Philippines, monthly average landing of this species have been about 20 kg, well below the 109 kg average in 2002 (Choo 2008).</p>    <p>In India,&#160; <em>Holothuria scabra</em>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. spinifera</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bohadschia marmorata</span>  have been collected over the last 1000 years.  Fishermen began  collecting other species in 1990 in response to high export value and  population declines.  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinpyga echinites</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. miliaris</span> populations were overexploited in some areas as early as 2 years later (Bruckner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2003).  Particularly in the Gulf of Manner and Pal Bay, CPUE and size of  specimens has dramatically declined (Bruckner et al. 2003).</p><p>In Seychelles, it used to be collected in large numbers, but landings have decreased to very low levels. It is considered overexploited (Aumeeruddy and Conand 2008). In Tanzania, this species used to dominate the catches (Mgaya and Mmbaga 2007). In Egypt, it is almost completely lost (Lawrence <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004).</p>    In Madagascar, declining exports, quality and size of sea cucumbers, including this species, indicate that resources are overexploited (1998) (Bruckner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003). In Mozambique, high fluctuation in exports of this species, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Holothuria nobilis</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. fuscogilva</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. atra</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinpyga echinites</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana</span> may be due to irregular reporting or to overexploitation. Catch here was reported at 500 t in 1990, 700 t in 1993, 6 t in 1995, and 54 t in 1996.  In Inhambane Province, holothurian fisheries are closed until stocks rebuild (Bruckner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003). Kalaeb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2008) used transect data to calculate a population density of 7.5 individuals/ha of this species in Eritrea. In East Africa, fisheries for this species may now have trouble finding brood stocks (Conand pers. comm. 2010).",Decreasing,"This species is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific between latitudes 30°N and  30°S (Hamel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2001), from South Africa to the Red Sea, India, China and Japan to Australia, and to Micronesia in the northeast and Tonga in the southeast. In Madagascar, this species is observed in the west coast from the south of Toliara to Nosy-be (Rasolofonirina pers. comm. 2010).","<p>This species has been targeted in fisheries throughout its range for  hundreds of years, with periods of high and low abundance. However,  fishing pressure has dramatically increased in the past 25 to 50 years,  since the 1960s, and is expected to continue, even as stocks are  depleted. When this occurs, other species are often targeted in their  place. <br/></p><p>In the Western Pacific Region, this species  is commercially exploited in FSM, Kiribati, Wallis and Futuna, PNG,  Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Torres Strait, Great  Barrier Reef, Moreton Bay, Northern Australia and Western Australia  (Australia) where it is consumed either whole or their intestines and/or  gonads are consumed as delicacies or as protein in traditional diets;  local consumption is of greater importance in times of hardship (i.e.  following cyclones). There is a subsistence fishery in Palau, Wallis and  Futuna, PNG and Fiji. In Palau, the gonads and/or intestines of this  species are consumed. In PNG, this species is consumed, often grilled,  in the Western Central Province and in the Milne Bay province. In 1989,  this species accounted for 70% of the total catches for export; however  recent activity has shifted to low value species due to its decline. In  Fiji, it is also consumed locally in coconut sauce. In New Caledonia,  this species is among the most dominant species in the catch however  export statistics show declines in catches of this species and increase  of others (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). </p>    <p>In  Asia, this species is harvested in China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand,  Viet Nam, Indonesia and Philippines. In Thailand, it was originally  consumed locally but then in 1970s an export fishery started. In  Viet Nam, it is also part of an export fishery (Choo 2008).

In Vanuatu, a sea ranching venture with  this species was initiated by an Australian company using juveniles  produced in the Australian-based hatchery. A private Australian company  has been successful in mass producing this species in a hatchery in  Queensland. Thousands of juveniles have been released in designated  aquaculture areas over the last few years (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2008). This species has been bred on an experimental scale in India,  Indonesia, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Viet Nam and the Maldives with  reproductive, settling and feeding cycle completed (Choo 2008). In  China, it is a candidate for sea cucumber farming due to its high  commercial value (Chen 2004).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>",Marine,"<p>For stocks in Papua New Guinea, Kinch <em>et al.</em> (2008) note  “Arguably, the declines in abundances of <em>Holothuria scabra </em>and <em>H. whitmaei </em>could  qualify them for CITES listing”.

The Moreton Bay fishery (Australia) for this species is managed through permits as a developmental fishery. In Australia, a ban was put in place between 1996 and 2000, but no significant recovery was observed (Purcell 2010). In the Solomon Islands, release of cultured juveniles is sometimes used  for restoring and enhancing natural stocks of this species (Battaglene  1999). In the Philippines the exporters observe a size limit 6.35 cm (dry length). However, bans are often not permanent.

Based on a number of quantitative and qualitative studies, populations are estimated to have declined by 80-90% in at least 50% of its range, and are considered overexploited in at least 30% of its range although exact declines are difficult to estimate. Declines and overexploitation have occurred primarily since the 1960s, and although generation length is not known, echinoderms are not considered to go through senescence and therefore may be greater than several decades. Additionally, this species may be more vulnerable to overfishing given its low fecundity and late sexual maturation. This species is therefore listed as Endangered. However, better and more quantitative data are needed to better estimate the impact of fishing on this species.","This species is found along slopes and passes within reef zones (Skewes <em>et al.</em> 2004) and along outer reef flats (Conand and Mangion 2002) to depths of 35 m, but is more common in waters from 10-20 m. It is a large, conspicuous species, with relatively lower fecundity and relatively low weight gonads and sexual maturity, making it more vulnerable to overfishing (Conand 1998).<br/><br/>They are distributed mainly in shallow coral reef areas, on reef flats, reef slopes and near passes on sandy or hard bottoms with large rubble and coral patches.

This species is found from 3-30 m. <br/><br/>General genus information: throughout its range, <em>Acropora</em> can be found on any stretch of reef and is often the dominant coral, especially along the reef front. Staghorn and plate forms flourish in sheltered areas, whereas clusters and semi-massive types can withstand more exposed conditions.

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category, however due to the susceptibility of bleaching events this species is listed as Near Threatened. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found in deep water or protected reef backs and lagoons. It is very common in sandy environments including subtidal protected sandy slopes and lagoon floors (Wallace 1999). This species is found from 3-50 m depth.<br/><br/>General genus information: throughout its range, <em>Acropora</em> can be found on any stretch of reef and is often the dominant coral, especially along the reef front. Staghorn and plate forms flourish in sheltered areas, whereas clusters and semi-massive types can withstand more exposed conditions. Species that occur from the reef top to the reef slope become gradually more flattened with depth (Wood 1983).","Threats include coral removal and harvesting for display in aquariums and for the curio-trade. This species probably occurs in the aquarium trade (Delbeek pers. comm.). <br/><br/>This is a delicate species and particularly vulnerable to physical damage. Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is a common species.

However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/><em>Acropora</em> species are in the top three genera collected for the aquarium trade. This species may be in the aquarium trade (Delbeek pers. comm.). It is not known to what extent this particular species is collected, or the extent of threat this presents.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is rare, being apparently absent on most reefs (Wallace 1999).

It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

However, this species occurs across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

This species is restricted to enclosed lagoons and protected reef slope habitats and thus may be missed on many reefs (Wallace 1999). This species is found from 2-18 m (Fenner and Richards pers. comm.).<br/><br/>General genus information: throughout its range, <em>Acropora</em> can be found on any stretch of reef and is often the dominant coral, especially along the reef front. Staghorn and plate forms flourish in sheltered areas, whereas clusters and semi-massive types can withstand more exposed conditions. Species that occur from the reef top to the reef slope become gradually more flattened with depth (Wood 1983).","Major threats are bleaching and reef destruction. This species is generally found in lagoon or reef slope habitats protected from strong wave action that are generally more susceptible to bleaching.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>Threats include coral removal and harvesting for display in aquariums and for the curio-trade. The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 25.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 23% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found in shallow protected embayments, and also at mid depths. This species is found to at least 25 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is an uncommon species that is sometimes locally common.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species.

We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs.

However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a wide range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming.

It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and is therefore is listed as Least Concern. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found in shallow turbid water, and also in clear water habitats. This species is found to at least 20 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

This species is particularly susceptible to crown-of-thorns predation, storm damage, and bleaching (Richards pers. comm.). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is common, and conspicuous.<br/><br/>This species is the most widespread and abundant of the <em>Acropora</em> species in the Hawaiian Archipelago with its highest densities in this area found in the French Frigate Shoals (Kenyon 1992). In the French Frigate Shoals, it has a patchy distribution with several areas of high abundance (Kenyon <em>et al</em>. 2006). Only two specimens had been recorded in the main Hawaiian Islands until August 2006 when two colonies were observed by divers at Mana Reef, Kauai (Kenyon <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>On the outer reef flat of central Vietnam's reefs, <em>A. cytherea</em> is one of two species that dominate in both degree of substrate coverage and size of many circled colonies reaching 3 m across (Latypov 2001).<br/><br/>It was found at 55 sites of 87 sites surveyed in the Marshall Islands (Richards pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species.

We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is uncommon.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, and other threats and therefore population decline is based on both the percentage of destroyed reefs and critical reefs that are likely to be destroyed within 20 years (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage destroyed reefs.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

However, it is particularly susceptible to bleaching, crown-of-thorns starfish predation, and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 37% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A4c. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species occurs in shallow reef environments, especially shallow to mid reef slopes. This species is found from 2 m to at least 20 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is widespread, and occurs across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

However, it is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, crown-of-thorns starfish predation, and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 36% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A4ce. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found mostly in lagoons. This species is found to at least 20 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast. This species occurs especially in lagoons. These habitats have been particularly affected by high sea temperature-induced bleaching.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 281.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is an uncommon species that is sometimes locally common.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 35% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A4ce. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.",This species occurs in shallow reef environments and lagoons. This species is found to at least 15 m.,"The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is a rare species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, and other threats and therefore population decline is based on both the percentage of destroyed reefs and critical reefs that are likely to be destroyed within 20 years (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage destroyed reefs.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 21% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments.

However, this species is widespread, and occurs across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and very common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments. It is found on shallow reef slopes with a high <em>Acropora</em> spp. diversity, but it is protected from strong wave action. It is found subtidally on submerged reefs and gentle reef slopes (Wallace 1999). This species is found from 5-25 m.","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/><em>Acropora</em> species are in the top three genera collected for the aquarium trade. This species is known to occur in the aquarium trade (Delbeek pers. comm.). The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 12.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This species is common in shallow water.

It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments on protected reef slopes. This species is found to at least 10 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is an uncommon species, but can be locally abundant.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, and other threats and therefore population decline is based on both the percentage of destroyed reefs and critical reefs that are likely to be destroyed within 20 years (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage destroyed reefs.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category.

Although this species is harvested commercially and it is thought that there is a decline in abundance, this is complicated by the apparent recent decline in fishing effort. At present the fishery is thought to be 'stable' as there is no evidence of it being 'mined', or of growth over-fishing. However, it is recommended that populations off the northwest coast of Australia continue to be monitored, with the possibility of stricter controls on the fishery in the future.","This species occurs on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Globigerina</span> at depths of 418 m to 500 m (Holthuis 1991, Australian Faunal Directory 2008). It commonly feeds on other crustaceans, but also fish and squid (Wassenberg and Hill 1989). Females are thought to mature at 4+ years (~ 40 mm carapace length), and maximum lifespan is 10-12 years (Rainer 1992). Clutch size is approximately 1,200 eggs (R. Wahle pers. comm. 2009).","This species is fished commercially by trawlers off the northwest coast of Australia. It was the most abundant lobster off the northwest Australian coast, making up 38% of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Metanephrops </span>catch in the 1980s (Wallner and Phillips 1988).

However, this has coincided with a decrease in fishing effort (hours trawled) which complicates interpretations of decreasing catch volume (Lynch and Garvey 2005).<br/><br/>Data for catch per unit effort (CPUE) for all three commercial Australian lobster species shows an overall decline from around 14 kg/hr in 1985 to 9 kg/hr in 2003 (assuming an increase in fishing power of 1% per annum), with the lowest levels recorded in 2002 (Lynch and Garvey 2005). CPUE data is available for this species at one fishing ground (Rowley Shoals); this shows a linear decline over three generations from approx. 11 kg/hr in 1991 to 9 kg/hr in 2003. This amounts to an approx. 18 % decline over the period (Lynch and Garvey 2005).<br/><br/>Despite this, it is not believed that this species is being significantly impacted by commercial trawling (Lynch and Garvey 2005). This is due to several factors: firstly, there is no evidence that the fishery is being ""mined"" (vessels continuously find new areas of high abundance which are exploited until depletion, gradually fishing down the entire stock until a sudden and unanticipated collapse occurs), as most of the fishing grounds have been in constant use since 1985; secondly, a comparison of length frequencies between the early years of the fishery and 2004 shows no significant change in the size range of scampi being caught, giving evidence that CPUE's are not being distorted by ""growth overfishing"" (the practice of targeting greater numbers of smaller scampi to sustain total catch volumes) (Lynch and Garvey 2005).<br/><br/>* Calculations for catch volume decline:<br/>Age at maturity = 4 years.

10566196,41880,Haliotis cracherodii,Critically Endangered,A4e,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>H. cracherodii</em> began supporting a commercial fishery in California in 1968. In the mid 1980s a wasting disease, Withering Syndrome, began to appear, reducing the commercial catch considerably. At present, the harvest of black abalone is illegal in California, but the species is still harvested commercially in Mexico. At most surveyed locations where the disease was present, black abalone populations were reduced by more than 80%. Fishers on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island made the first observation of this disease in 1985. It has since spread throughout all the California Channel Islands and northwards to Monterey. In Mexico, cases of Withering Syndrome have been reported as far south as Cedros Island in Baja California. The spread of the disease now extends over almost the entire range of the species.

Withering Syndrome does not appear to showing any signs of relenting in its progression along the coast in either direction. The strong correlation between adult abundance and recruitment suggests that larvae do not disperse very far from their point of origin, thus depleted abalone populations are unlikely to be restored by recruitment from distant populations. 

If no action is taken,  it is estimated that <em>H. cracherodii</em> will decline by at least 80% over a period of three generations (from approximately 1975 to 2015), extending into the past and the future, and consequently, the species qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A4.","<em>H. cracherodii</em> is a sessile marine gastropod. It clamps tightly to rocky substrates and feeds on algal matter scraped from the rock surface. Gametes are released into the water where fertilization occurs to produce free-swimming larvae. Successful fertilization requires aggregated adults and synchronized gonad development and release (McShane 1996). After approximately 15 days as non-feeding zooplankton, the larvae metamorphose into their adult form, develop a shell, and settle onto a hard substrate (Douros 1985). Juveniles mainly reside in rocky crevices and feed primarily on benthic diatoms, bacterial films and algae found on coralline algal substrate (NMFS 2000). As juveniles, abalone are vulnerable to predators which graze the surfaces of coralline algae and associated species (McShane 1989). As they increase in size they become less vulnerable to predation and are able to emerge from their sheltered habitat and search out more desirable food sources (NMFS 2000). Adult abalone depend primarily on drift algae (Tegner and Dayton 1987). Main predators of adult abalone are fishes, otters and humans.
<br/>
<br/>Most black abalone are found in the intertidal zone, ranging from the high tide line to a depth of up to five meters (Lindberg 1989).
<br/>
<br/>Generation time is not easy to determine. Individuals do not display the same growth rate and older individuals may cease to grow altogether (B. Tissot, Washington University, pers comm.). Reproductive maturity is reached between three and seven years (when They are re approximately 130-150 mm in length), but life expectancy ranges from 25 to 75 years. Taking an average of these provides only a very rough estimate for the average age of parents, especially since the relationship between age and fecundity is unknown. Nonetheless, generation time is estimated to be between 14 and 41 years, thus a minimum three generation period would be 42 years (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001).","Withering Syndrome (WS) is the main threat to black abalone. It is manifested by epipodial discoloration, loss of appetite, severe weight loss and atrophy of the foot muscle. As a consequence, abalone lose their ability to adhere to the substratum and eventually die (Tissot 1991, Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1992). The first reports of WS were in black abalone were made by fishers on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island (Lafferty and Kuris 1993). The disease then spread throughout all the Californian Channel Islands from 1985 to 1992, except Santa Catalina Island, where no studies have been conducted (Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1992, Lafferty and Kuris 1993, Van Blaricom <em>et al.</em> 1993). At most surveyed locations black abalone were initially reduced to less than 20% of their initial densities (Tissot 1990, Davis <em>et al.</em> 1992, Richards and Davis 1993, Altstatt <em>et al.</em> 1996). Some have completely lost their black abalone populations (P. Hakker pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>Black abalone are also affected by the large human population inhabiting southern California, the majority of which reside within 50 km of the coast (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992). Coastal development, such as residential areas, harbours and coastal access points and large ocean discharges of municipal and industrial wastes contribute to the degradation  and loss of near shore habitat (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992).  Commercial and recreational fishing have also placed black abalone populations under intense pressure. The large decline in fisheries landings may have been a consequence of over harvesting (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992), however the mass mortality of populations in the Channel Islands that began in 1985 has been attributed to WS and continued fishing (Haaker <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/> <br/>Other possible threats to the species include storm, competition with other marine organisms and predation (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001).","Large-scale commercial fishery of black abalone began in California in 1968 (Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1995). Like most other abalone fisheries, black abalone landings underwent a rapid rise, peaking in 1973 at a maximum catch of over 800 metric tonnes, followed by a decline (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1992). In 1992, commercial landings had diminished to 17.4 metric tonnes, as a wasting disease, Withering Syndrome (WS) spread throughout southern California (Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1992, Haaker <em>et al.</em> 1995).",Decreasing,"The black abalone, <em>Haliotis cracherodii</em>, is found in intertidal waters off California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico.",,Marine,"All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game. The restrictions employed can range from minimum legal size limits and bag limits  to harvest seasons and closures (Breen 1989, P. Haaker pers. comm.). The harvest of black abalone is currently illegal in California.
<br/>
<br/>In Mexico, green abalone, <em>H. fulgens</em> and pink abalone <em>H. corugata</em> are the main focus of commercial fishery. Black abalone do not form a large proportion of total abalone landings. Exclusive rights to abalone exploitation were granted to cooperative fishers' organizations. Although new legislation in 1992 allowed for the entry of the private sector into the fishery, all abalone harvesting is still done by cooperatives (Ramande-Villanueva <em>et al.</em> 1998). Total allowable catches per cooperative (TACCs) were introduced in 1973, but their criteria have changed appreciably over the years (Ramande-Villanueva <em>et al.</em> 1998). Since black abalone make up such a small proportion of the commercial catch in Mexico, it is difficult to assess the impact of these regulations on the species.
<br/>
<br/>In January 1999 the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) published its updated list of candidate species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Black abalone was one of 14 new species added to the list (NMFS 1999). The NMFS intends to conduct a review to determine whether black abalone deserves a national listing of endangered or threatened (P. Haaker, pers. comm.).  Listing as a candidate species does not, however, provide substantive or procedural protection for the species under the ESA (NMFS 1999).
<br/>
<br/>Stock restoration by transplantation from distant populations has been proposed to restore depleted populations (Tissot 1997). Smith <em>et al.</em> (2001) propose that both American and Mexican fishery authorities work together to develop a re-stocking program to help restore black abalone populations all along the coast, especially in key locations such as the Channel Islands. Since the greatest threat facing the black abalone is disease, special precaution must be taken to ensure that the transplantation of adult abalone does not create a new path for the spread of WS. 
<br/>
<br/>While not an especially charismatic species, many living in coastal California and Baja California recognize that the black abalone is important to local economies. A well designed public education campaign may result in a successful appeal for public funding (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001). 
<br/>
<br/>There is a need to survey areas where the  status of black abalone populations are currently unknown, namely the coastline between Los Angeles and central Baja California, in addition to new surveys being carried out at sites previously examined. A study of withered black abalone at the northern fringe of WS's current range (Monterey and San Francisco) (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001).
<br/>
<br/>Perhaps most importantly, further investigation of WS itself is also needed (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2001), including investigation into whether WS is caused by an introduced pathogen, identification of other species that may serve as reservoir hosts, and identification of resistant individuals for potential brood stock and development of husbandry.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to bleaching and disease and is collected for the aquarium trade, therefore it is listed as Near Threatened.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and is heavily harvested for the aquarium trade and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is widespread, and occurs across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 7,298.

It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in all tropical reef environments. It is commonly found from 3-11 m, rarely 1-2 m and 12-15 m, in the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam (Titlyanov and Titlyanova 2002). It is very common on shallow reef flats in highly fluctuating environments, and is resistant to warming and high salinity. This species is found on subtidal rock and rocky reefs, in the outer reef channel, on the back and foreslopes of reefs, in lagoons and in inter-reef soft and rubble substrate. This species is found to at least 50 m.","In Malaysia and Singapore, of the <em>Cyphastrea</em> species it is one of the more susceptible to bleaching, but it recovers fast. <br/><br/>This species is targeted for the aquarium trade.

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004).

Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in most reef environments. It is commonly found from 1-15 m, rarely from 18-20 m, in the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam (Titlyanov and Titlyanova 2002).

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 21% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to bleaching and disease and is collected for the aquarium trade, therefore it is listed as Near Threatened.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/><em>Acropora</em> species are in the top three genera collected for the aquarium trade. This species is known in the aquarium trade (Delbeek pers. comm.).

Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is a common species.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 201. In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. However, this is an encrusting species that is probably not significantly harvested.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","This is a common species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern. However, because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification it will be important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is also observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species occurs in shallow, tropical reef environments on upper to lower reef slopes and in lagoons. This species is found to at least 40 m.","The bleaching of coral reefs, which has become increasingly frequent since the 1970s, is related to the ongoing rise in ocean in temperatures as a result of global climate change. Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a wide range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to bleaching and disease and is collected for the aquarium trade, therefore it is listed as Near Threatened.

Monospecific stands of this species are particularly vulnerable to disease outbreaks (Willis and Page pers. comm.). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/><em>Acropora</em> species are in the top three genera collected for the aquarium trade.

Population responses, in terms of abundance, geographic range and viability inform risk at the country level, which in turn, informs the assessment of the species' risk of extinction.<br/><u><br/></u><strong><u>Population Reduction</u><br/></strong><br/><em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> is an inshore, coastal species. Its distribution area is vast and complex, extending in a north to south range, from Japan with a temperate climate in the north, through mainland of the People’s Republic of China (hereafter abbreviated to China), Taiwan (province of China, hereafter abbreviated to Taiwan), Hong Kong (a Special Administrative Region of China, hereafter abbreviated to Hong Kong), Viet Nam, Philippines, Brunei Darussalam and East Malaysia to Indonesia, with a tropical climate in the south. There is genetic evidence for subpopulations within its range and it appears to exhibit differing population profiles, with historically dense populations in its northern range (Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam) and low population densities in its southern range (Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Indonesia).<br/><br/>Its life-history habits with five distinct stages make it vulnerable to a variety of threats at each stage of its development. High tide spawning sites and intertidal juvenile nursery habitat are critical to its survival needs, but the occurrence of such habitats is not universal; they occur intermittently throughout its range based on hydrology, geomorphology, sedimentology and the species' own habitat preferences. Whilst the coastlines where <em>T. tridentatus</em> ranges are long, these critical areas of occupancy, comprising the actual used and useable areas utilized as spawning habitat and intertidal juvenile nursery grounds, are relatively small in area. As a consequence, within its range, spawning and intertidal habitats do not equate to all available coastline because only select areas of it constitute suitable habitat. Furthermore, where horseshoe crab species occur sympatrically (such as localities in China and Hong Kong where <em>T. tridentatus</em> and <em>Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda</em> coexist together) juvenile nursery grounds on intertidal flats are spatially delineated into sandy facies (favoured by juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em>) and muddy facies (favoured by juvenile <em>C. rotundicauda</em>), further restricting the extent of useable area available for juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> to forage.<br/><br/>Where data are available, significant population declines (See Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) and habitat declines (See Table 2 in the Supplementary Material) have been documented in Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Viet Nam, with declining population trends being reported by fishermen in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.<br/><br/>Because of their coastal location, <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning habitat and juvenile nursery grounds are highly susceptible to reclamation, mariculture projects or are suffering from the adverse impacts of coastal infrastructure construction and sea sand extraction. The species has experienced different levels of habitat loss or degradation throughout much of its range, with studies indicating that infrastructure projects have contributed to extirpations, instances of restricted gene flow, low haplotype diversity, and the creation of population bottlenecks indicative of impending extirpation. Whilst many habitats have been lost completely, recruitment has ceased at many previously healthy spawning sites, for reasons that are still not clear. The result is the presence of remnant populations in Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia population densities are low, common threats occur and population declines have been reported. Population data are not available for Vietnam or Brunei Darussalam. The risk profiles vary between countries.<br/><br/><strong>Japan</strong>: <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once abundant on all of the coasts of the Seto Inland Sea. There is no <em>T. tridentatus</em> fishery in Japan. Populations have declined significantly because of habitat loss or degradation. Between 1930 to 1994 over 80% of horseshoe crab habitats disappeared in the Seto Inland Sea and the area of tidal flats in Japan has decreased by over 40% since 1945, whilst between the 1970’s to 2000’s seagrass beds, some of which support juvenile horseshoe crab populations were reduced by 40% in area. <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> was assessed to be Critically Endangered in 2006 mainly because of the loss or deterioration of its tidal flat habitats. Reports of extirpations in Japan are not uncommon. <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> has disappeared from many of its spawning grounds, whilst other sites have recorded significant decreases in visits by spawning pairs.&#160; Small, remnant populations remain, some are conservation-reliant for their survival and spawning habitat and juvenile nursery grounds are still threatened with development.<br/><br/><strong>China</strong>: <em>T. tridentatus </em>was once abundant in high densities throughout its range in China. Mass spawning events were a common sight and it was regarded as an important economic species, both to supply the biomedical industry and for consumption. In both cases, all of the animal is used, resulting in 100% mortality. Population declines of ≥90% have been recorded throughout much of its range in China and a number of important fisheries collapsed between the 1970s and 1990s. In parallel to overfishing, land reclamation between the 1950s and the 1990s drastically shrunk intertidal habitats. <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> was assessed as Endangered in 2004 because populations had seriously declined due to its over-exploitation as a source of raw material for chitin, the utilization of its blood in the medical and biomedical industries and the use of its meat for food. Subsequent to this, between 2008 and 2012 the mangrove area in China decreased by about 66% because of land reclamation and sea sand extraction has caused significant habitat degradation along almost the entire range of <em>T. tridentatus</em> on the mainland coast of China. Reports of extirpations are not uncommon. Between 2006 and 2010, no spawning was observed during surveys of 27 nationally recognized spawning sites and a few juveniles were found at only six of the sites, representing an 88% decline in habitat utilization. Dongshan Bay in Fujian went from having abundant adult populations in the early 1980s to no spawning being observed and only juvenile populations being found during surveys between 2006 and 2010. Commercially, limuloid resources are exhausted in China, yet as late as 2011, the Guangxi Government was still promoting the horseshoe crab fishery in Beibu Gulf, demand for <em>T. tridentatus</em> as a culinary treasure and to supply the biomedical industry is high and remaining populations are being targeted to meet these demands.<br/><br/><strong>Taiwan</strong>: <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once abundant in high densities throughout its range in Taiwan, but populations have been extirpated or declined significantly because of habitat loss or degradation. On Taiwan Island, 55% of the natural coastline, particularly on the west coast, which was home to the majority of <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning grounds in Taiwan has been lost to reclamation or degraded because of coastal infrastructure construction, to the extent it is extirpated at many localities and is on the verge of extirpation on Taiwan Island. Similar habitat loss and degradation has occurred on Kinmen Island, due to the reclamation, dredging of subtidal areas and sea sand extraction. No adults or mating pairs have been recorded on the intertidal flats of Taiwan Island since the 1960’s, nor more recently from Kinmen. When population surveys commenced in Taiwan in 2003, they were conducted on juvenile populations because of the lack of adults. Where juveniles still exist, populations are declining and most of the remaining sites support non-viable juvenile populations.<br/><br/><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once widespread and abundant in Hong Kong with thriving populations until the 1980s, but by the early 1990s it had disappeared from much of its range. Significant population declines occurred because of overfishing to supply the biomedical industry, combined with significant levels of habitat loss or degradation. Population declines of ≥90% can be inferred in Hong Kong. Spawning was last scientifically observed in 1986 and when population surveys commenced in 2002, they were conducted on juvenile populations because of the lack of adults.<br/><br/><strong>Viet Nam</strong>: Up to the early 1980s major concentrations of <em>T. tridentatus</em> could be found along the coast of Viet Nam, at least as far south as Nha-Trang, but populations have declined significantly through a combination of overfishing to supply the biomedical industry and to meet consumer demand in China, in parallel with significant levels of habitat loss or degradation. <em>Tachypeus tridentatus</em> was assessed as Vulnerable in Viet Nam in 2007, based on a population decline of 50%, a fisheries catch decline of 20% and a decline in area of occupancy of 50% between 1990 and 2007. Subsequent to this, Viet Nam lost 40% of its mangroves between 2006 and 2012 and 56% of the remainder are planted mangroves and considered of low ecological value. Seagrass bed coverage in Viet Nam decreased from 40% to 70% between 2009 and 2014 and the coast of Viet Nam’s central coastal provinces, where <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once most abundant has been transformed since 1999 through a combination of shrimp farming, tourism infrastructure construction and sand mining, which have destroyed thousands of hectares of the ecosystem, so that its ecosystem service functions are now severely diminished. <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> is a legally exploitable resource in Viet Nam and demand from China to supply the biomedical market and to meet consumer demand remains high.<br/><br/><strong>Philippines</strong>: Historic information suggests <em>T. tridentatus </em>was once widely distributed throughout the Sulu Sea, but it experienced significant declines in numbers in the decades preceding 2000. Spawning sites and nursery grounds are threatened by coastal construction and sand mining and because of their close proximity to human population centres, they suffer from high rates of incompatible habitat use. Surveys in 2001 and 2002 indicated the presence of small juvenile populations at two renowned nursery beaches in Palawan.<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia</strong>: <em>T. tridentatus</em> is only found in Sabah and Sarawak. Where surveys have been conducted in Sabah, they indicate the presence of small, low density populations. Horseshoe crabs, including <em>T. tridentatus </em>form an important income component for poor fishermen and are a dietary component of Bajau Laut fishermen. Population declines have been reported by fishermen. The adverse impact of selective fishing practices on adult populations is likely evident in the male-biased Operational Sex Ratios (OSR) observed in Sabah, which is believed to reflect the selective targeting of gravid females by coastal and artisanal fisheries. Because of their close proximity to human population centres, spawning sites and nursery grounds suffer from high rates of incompatible habitat use. No population, habitat or threat data is currently available for Sarawak,<br/><br/><strong>Brunei Darussalam</strong>: Formal studies have just commenced, so population, habitat and threat data are not available. Because of its small geographic area, it is unlikely significant populations are resident here.<br/><br/><strong>Indonesia</strong>: Formal studies have just commenced, so population, habitat and threat data are not available. Population declines have been reported by fishermen. Because of their close proximity to human population centres, spawning sites and nursery grounds suffer from high rates of incompatible habitat use. Land reclamation of spawning habitats and juvenile nursery grounds has occurred in Indonesia.<br/><br/>A significant contributor to past population declines and the future near-term threat to <em>T. tridentatus </em>is the unmanaged, unsustainable harvest of adults to supply the biomedical industry and the selective targeting of gravid females to meet consumer demands (See Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). The long-term threat to <em>T. tridentatus</em> is the loss or degradation of spawning habitat and juvenile nursery grounds by reclamation, mariculture projects or the adverse impacts of coastal infrastructure construction and sea sand extraction, because these factors are leading to local populations being extirpated and their impacts are not reversible. <br/><br/>The generation length of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in its northern range has been estimated to be 20.25 years (giving a 3-generation length of 60.75 years [rounded to 60 years]). There is evidence to suggest different age-to-maturity rates at different latitudes, so that the generation length for southern populations could be considerably shorter.<br/><br/>In terms of future exploitation, the increasing demand driven by the projected growth of the Amebocyte Lysate industry and the categorization of <em>T. tridentatus</em> as a culinary treasure in China constitute high risk threats that will have considerable impact on remaining populations, and with the exception of Japan which has no horseshoe crab fishery, it will be aggressively targeted to meet these demands. In its southern range, artisanal fisheries, particularly the selective harvesting of gravid females in small or depleted populations can and in future will have significant negative impact, as evidenced by the male-biased Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) recorded in eastern Malaysia.&#160; <br/><br/>Furthermore, once recruitment at a site has stopped, the chances of recolonization and natural population recovery are low. Specific spawning and juvenile nursery habitat preferences, limited dispersal capabilities of larvae and juveniles, limited adult migratory behavior, topographic barriers to migration, genetic isolation and restricted or limited gene flow between geographically close populations and evidence of endemism means natural recruitment to abandoned spawning locations could take generation length time spans for populations to re-establish themselves and at many sites, because of lasting changes to local hydrology and sedimentology, recolonization may not occur because the changes may not be reversible.<br/><br/>Because of the combination of over-harvest and habitat loss, an ongoing population reduction, based on past estimates starting circa 1980 and future projections extending at least for the next two decades, suggest a reduction of ≥50% over a period of about 60 years or 3 generations in a significant portion of the species range.<br/><br/><br/><u><strong>Risk Assessment</strong></u><u><strong><br/></strong></u><em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> is facing relentless and unremitting anthropogenic threats from multiple stressors on a range of fronts. Major population declines have been reported throughout much of its range, all life-history stages face a combination of threats, including targeting of adults for its high value blood, chitin and eggs, high levels of habitat degradation, loss or abandonment, low resilience to exploitation including long age-to-maturity time, low juvenile recruitment rates, specific spawning and juvenile nursery habitat preferences and largely unregulated, continuing fishing pressure and these threats have not ceased and in some cases they are not reversible.<br/><br/>Up to the early 1980s, when survey data are first available, <em>T. tridentatus</em> was abundant with high population densities in much of its northern range, but since then, it has experienced significant population declines throughout much of its range, caused by a combination of unmanaged exploitation and significant levels of habitat loss or degradation It is extirpate at many localities and is still threatened with habitat loss throughout much of its range. The increasing demand for <em>T. tridentatus</em>, driven by the projected growth of the Amebocyte Lysate market and to meet consumer demands following its categorization as a culinary treasure in China constitute high risk threats that will result in future exploitation of remaining populations, and with the exception of Japan, it will be aggressively targeted to meet these demands. Its exploitation as an all-parts-use animal means populations have little chance of recovery. <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> has historically been subject to high levels of exploitation and it is predicted to be the subject of future high levels of exploitation, compounded by significant levels of habitat loss and degradation in the past and likely losses of spawning habitat and juvenile nursery grounds in the future. In summary, these threats have not ceased, in many instances they are not reversible and the future risk and impact of these threats are assessed to be high to extremely high throughout its range. Based on these factors and because of an ongoing population reduction of ≥50% over a period of about 60 years (three generations), <em>T. tridentatus </em>is assessed as Endangered.<br/><br/>In addition to the Endangered global assessment, a number of country level assessments have been designated for <em>T. tridentatus </em>as follows: Critically Endangered in Japan (2006), Endangered in China (2009) and Vulnerable in Viet Nam (2007).","All four extant species of horseshoe crab have different habitat requirements at different stages of their life cycle and their habitat requirements and life-history characteristics appear to be similar (Shuster 1982). Each of the species has specific and specialized habitat requirements related to spawning, juvenile development and adulthood and the close proximity of different habitats to meet the differing demands of their various stages of development is critical to their survival needs (Shuster and Sekiguchi 2009).<br/><br/>In <em>T. tridentatus</em>, beaches are needed for laying eggs along the high tide mark. There must be intertidal mudflats in close proximity, preferably with seagrass beds, so juveniles can develop and mature. It is also essential to have shallow water offshore in which large juveniles and sub-adults can feed and deeper water offshore for adults to forage after the spawning season is over (Itow 1993, Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, Wada <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Horseshoe crab spawning and juvenile intertidal habitats are subject to spatial and temporal variations because of the complex interrelationship between hydrology, geomorphology, light, temperature, nutrients and other environmental factors, as well as chemical variations, caused by factors such as variable river discharge, tributaries with different input composition, precipitation and influx of materials at the sediment-water interface. At a given time, environmental conditions and hydrographic features together may influence certain biological processes including distribution, abundance, physiology and reproduction, as well as the phytoplankton which supports the benthic macro- and meio-fauna at the base of the food chain (Rathod 1992). Such factors guide site selection and site avoidance for all life-style stages.<br/><br/>Populations of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in the northern part of its range are found in coastal muddy bottom regions, whilst the southern populations live along sandy coasts and often in coral reefs, indicating adaption to different living environments through its range (Sekiguchi 1988, pp. 32, 53, 414).<br/><br/>For more details on spawning, larval development, growth, mortality, and biology and ecology, see the 'Habitat, Biology &amp; Ecology' section in the Supplementary Information.<strong><br/><br/><br/></strong><u><strong>Generation Length</strong></u><br/><br/>Generation length in <em>T. tridentatus </em>has been estimated based on the following: <br/><br/>Although there is variation in generation length among horseshoe crab species, all are relatively slow maturing, exhibiting particularly slow growth rates, and age-to-maturity for <em>T. tridentatus</em> is the longest of the four extant species.<br/><br/>Studies of <em>Limulus polyphemus</em> indicated it takes 9-10 years to reach maturity (Shuster and Sekiguchi 2003); the longest live retrieval in an adult tagging study in a published report was 10 years (Swan 2005), whilst in the United States Fish and Wildlife Services adult Horseshoe Crab Tagging Program 13 crabs were retrieved alive 15-17 years after they were tagged (Laurie/Newhard 2018, pers. comm.), suggesting at least similar times can be used for age-to-maturity and age-at-maturity estimates. <br/><br/>In <em>T. tridentatus</em> there is evidence to suggest different age-to-maturity rates at different latitudes, but in Japan and China, where data are available, estimates for age-to-maturity are between 13 to 14 years, the female taking longer than the male to reach maturity (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 194; Hu <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Based on the retrieval times recorded in tagging studies for <em>L. polyphemus</em>, this assessment adopts a conservative approach and uses similar times for age-to-maturity and age-at-maturity, giving a generation length of 20.25 years (maturity plus one half reproductive longevity) for <em>T. tridentatus</em>, resulting in a 3-generation length of 60.75 years (rounded to 60 years).<br/><u><strong></strong></u>","<p>The following sub-sections summarize the country level assessment and list the potential threats of <em>T. tridentatus</em> throughout its range. As concluded by Hu <em>et al</em>. (2015) from a study of three juvenile nursery grounds in Beibu Gulf, China, once a local horseshoe crab population is extirpated, even under ideal conditions, it would take a long period of time for them to re-establish themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Assessments of Country Threats</strong></p>  <p>Country level assessment on <em>T. tridentatus</em> has been conducted only in Japan, China and Vietnam thus far and a synopsis is given below.<br/><br/>In Japan,<em> T. tridentatus</em> was assessed to be Critically Endangered (CR + EN) in the Red List and the Red Data Book of Japan in 2006 (Ministry of the Environment Japan 2006), mainly because of the loss or deterioration of its tidal flat habitats (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 15) and marine and coastal ecosystem habitat and biodiversity loss in Japan has not been contained or halted. It is a continuing trend (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 22).<br/><br/>In China,<em> T. tridentatus</em> was assessed in 2004 (year of assessment) to be Endangered (EN A2ac) in the China Species Red List because populations had seriously declined due to its over-exploitation as a source of raw material for chitin, the utilization of its blood in the medical and biomedical industries and the use of its meat for food. Annual yields in the 1970’s amounted to 200,000 pairs but by 2004, it had become difficult to obtain (China Species Red List 2009a, b).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam,<em> T. tridentatus</em> was assessed to be Vulnerable (VU A1c, Ba, b, c) in the Viet Nam Red Data Book in 2007 because it was estimated its population declined by 50% and its area of occupancy declined by 50% between 1990 and 2007 (Nguyen 2007).</p><p><br/><strong>Biomedical Harvest</strong><br/><br/>Horseshoe crabs are harvested by the biomedical industry for the manufacture of Amebocyte Lysate and because of its size, <em>T. tridentatus</em> is the primary source of Amebocyte Lysate in Asia, where the practice is to drain all of the animal’s blood resulting in its death (Hong 2011, p. 154; Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm).<br/><br/>According to market analysts, demand for Amebocyte Lysate is high and globally, the Amebocyte Lysate market maintained an average annual growth rate of 7.25% from US$231 million in 2013 to US$285 million in 2016. It is predicted the market will further expand, so that by 2021, the Amebocyte Lysate market size will reach US$386 million, a 35% increase in market size in five years (BisReport Information Consulting 2017).<br/><br/>Having largely depleted Chinese waters of commercially viable catches, the TAL industry is targeting Viet Nam as a supply source (Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm., Laurie/Do 2014, pers. comm.) and is also looking farther afield for new sources of supply, such as Indonesia (Laurie/John 2017, pers. comm). Scientists in Malaysia are also exploring the opportunities of capitalizing on horseshoe crab stocks, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Sabah to produce TAL and other pharmaceutical products (Noraznawati 2015).<br/><br/>Horseshoe crab carapaces are also in demand in China and overseas as a source of chitin, which is satisfied as a by-product of the TAL industry (China Species Red List 2009a, b, Hong 2011, p. 154) as well as collection by children and adults to supply this demand (Hong 2011, p. 154). This is one of the factors resulting in horseshoe crabs being an ‘all parts use animal’ (Hong 2011, p. 154, Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm.). The demand for carapaces for chitin is considered to represent a significant threat to <em>T. tridentatus</em> in China (China Species Red List 2009b).<br/><br/>The absence any sort of harvest regulations is considered to be a significant cause of the decline in <em>T. tridentatus</em> population numbers in Asia (Gauvry 2015).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Consumption</strong><br/><br/>The demand for <em>T. tridentatus</em> in China for consumption is high (Li <em>et al</em>. 2011; Hong 2011, p. 154; Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012; Laurie/Do 2014, pers. comm.) and moderate in Taiwan (Hsieh and Chen 2015), Hong Kong (Chiu and Morton 1999, Shin <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2014) and Viet Nam (Laurie/Do 2014, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Gravid females are the target of capture throughout its range by artisanal fisheries as a food source in the Philippines (Schoppe 2002), Indonesia (Meilana <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Sabah, Malaysia (Wood and Habibah 2014; Manca <em>et al</em>. 2015; Laurie/Mohamad 2017, pers. comm.), where female-biased harvesting may be contributing to male-biased OSR (Christianus and Saad 2007; Manca <em>et al</em>. 2015; Laurie/Mohamad 2017, pers. comm).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Trawling</strong><br/><br/>Two complementary advances in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century had considerable detrimental impact on <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations in China. Before the 1980s, fishing boats in China were largely reliant on man power, which limited the methods, capability and efficiency of fishing fleets. In the 1980’s, old fleets were gradually replaced with mechanized boats, accompanied by the introduction of trawls which could fish in water as deep as 20 m, opening up the seabed and therefore adult horseshoe crab habitat for exploitation (Hong 2011, p. 155). Capture on a commercial scale is still being promoted. According to the Department of Agriculture in Guangxi in 2011, there was an abundance of resources in the shallow seas around Guangxi, including dozens of thousands of tons of horseshoe crabs, with an annual output of 200,000 pairs (Department of Agriculture, Guangxi 2011).<br/><br/>Of all of the fishing methods, bottom trawling poses the highest risk to adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations because of its indiscriminate nature and the fact that <em>T. tridentatus </em>is an economically viable bycatch.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Artisanal Fisheries</strong><br/><br/>In Palawan, Philippines artisanal fishing activities including push netting, gill netting and the construction of closed lines forming fish corrals in subtidal areas facing spawning beaches pose major threats to <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations (Schoppe 2002). Increasing fishing activities around Puerto Princesa pose a serious threat to remaining populations (Almendral and Schoppe 2005).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, horseshoe crabs, including <em>T. tridentatus</em>, are collected for consumption, both locally and for export, forming an important income component for ‘poor’ fishermen in some areas (Mohamad et al. 2015) and commencing in 2017, instances of Thai tourists visiting Inderesabah in Sabah to buy gravid female <em>T. tridentatus</em>, extract their eggs, then take them back to Thailand have been reported (Laurie/Mohamad 2018, pers. comm).<br/><br/>The Bajau Laut, nomadic sea-farers along the south east coast of Sabah, consume horseshoe crabs as a component of their diets (Wood and Habibah 2014). They are specialist marine hunter-gatherers who make a living from freediving (Cullen <em>et al</em>. 2007) and represent one of the most widely dispersed Indigenous groups in Southeast Asia. They comprise a total population of approximately 1.1 million, with around 200,000 living in the islands of eastern Indonesia, 347,000 in Sabah, Malaysia and 564,000 in the Philippines (Stacey et al. 2018). &#160;Whilst such artisanal fisheries are low technology in nature, the impact of targeting gravid females can be high and have considerable negative impact, particularly when small or already depleted populations are involved. Their fishing activities may help explain the male biased OSR of 2.42:1 observed at Inderasabah (Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2016) and OSR of 2.08:1 observed at Tawau (Manca <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Bycatch</strong><br/><br/>Throughout Asia, horseshoe crabs are often considered as a nuisance by local fishermen and disposed of, because of their nuisance value in entangling nets, including in Japan (Iwaoka and Okayama 2009, p. 574; Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2015), China (Hong 2011, p. 155), Hong Kong (Laurie pers. obs.) and Malaysia, where they are killed as bycatch, or get trapped and die in abandoned ghost nets (Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Smuggling</strong><br/><br/><em>Tachypleus tridentatus </em>eggs are being targeted for smuggling in Sabah, Malaysia (Laurie/Mohamad 2018, pers. comm.) and in Indonesia, where even though they are protected, there is a substantial illegal trade in horseshoe crabs, which are usually smuggled via ports on the northeast coast of Sumatra to Malaysia, for onward transmission to Thailand (Laurie/Meilana 2015, pers. comm.; Laurie/John 2017, pers. comm.). Whilst the principal focus of this trade is gravid <em>T. gigas</em> for consumption in Thailand, seizures of <em>T. tridentatus </em>are also made (BKIPM 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Habitat Loss through Reclamation</strong><br/><br/>Reclamation and related activities pose a considerable threat to <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations, through destruction or degradation of all lifestyle stage habitats.<br/><br/>In Japan, following World War II, extensive land reclamation was carried out as a national policy to increase agricultural output (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 6). Tidal flats, which often exist in deeply indented bays tended to be developed. Hence, the area of tidal flats nationally was reduced by more than 40% between 1945 and 1995 due to landfilling and draining for land reclamation (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 15) and following large scale reclamations, many small scale land reclamations were also carried out (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 6). These activities were more prevalent in some areas than others. For example, over 80% of horseshoe crab habitats disappeared in the Seto Inland Sea from 1930 to 1994 (Shuster and Sekiguchi 2009), due to reclamation or revetment projects, which greatly diminished or totally destroyed spawning beaches there (Itow 1993, Tsuchiya 2009).<br/><br/>The effects of such land reclamations had a devastating effect on horseshoe crab populations. During the reclamation of the 106 ha Tomioka Bay in 1958, the remains of approximately 10,000 horseshoe crabs were found stranded (Nishii 1973; Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 8). When 1,800 ha of land were reclaimed in Kasaoka Bay, commencing in 1968, approximately 100,000 adult horseshoe crabs were estimated to be affected, and whilst efforts were made to transport the stranded adults to the sea, it was assessed that millions of juvenile horseshoe crabs perished (Seino et al. 2003, p. 8). In terms of long-term impact, a comparison of horseshoe crab spawning grounds on the Tenjin and Azuma coasts of Kasaoka showed a decrease from a maximum of around 400 breeding sites in the 1970s to no breeding sites after 1981 (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, pp. 5−6, Fig. 3).<br/><br/>In parallel, it is estimated seagrass beds in Japan were reduced by 40% in area from the 1970s to 2000s, but in addition to loss of habitat, rising sea temperature has been suggested as one of the causes for this decrease (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 15). Threats to <em>T. tridentatus</em> habitat in Japan have not ceased. In 2017, the local government at Sone Tidal flat, home to possibly the largest remaining horseshoe crab population in Japan was considering proposals to reclaim the intertidal flat to build a wind turbine farm (Laurie/Iwasaki 2017, pers. comm).<br/><br/>China recognizes that land reclamation from wetlands undertaken from the 1950s to the 1990s has drastically shrunk wetland habitat and the area of land reclamation from tidal flats is continuing (China NBSAP 5 2014). From the same report, the area of land reclamation from the seas from 2008 to 2012 reached 650.6 km² and as a result of land reclamation from tidal flats, mangrove area in China decreased by about two-thirds (66%), causing direct damage to habitats and reproduction sites for some important protected species. Before the 1990s, many coastal areas in China were remote and isolated because they lacked paved roads, but with economic development, new road networks were put in place to open up the coastal areas, which in turn allowed fishermen to transport their catches, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> to new markets (Hong 2011, p. 155). Despite being illegal, there is now considerable inter-province trade in which <em>T. tridentatus</em> is being internally smuggled from Guangdong and Guangxi to meet consumer demand in Zhejiang and Fujian (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the past, <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning beaches were also protected in many areas in Fujian because they were located in restricted military zones, but a relaxation of these restrictions has led to the opening up of these coastal areas to development (Hong 2011, p. 160).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, which comprises Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands, Kinmen and the Matsu Islands, two-thirds of Taiwan Island is hilly or mountainous, bisecting the island along a centre line into east and west corridors. The east of the Taiwan Island is scarcely populated, whilst 95% of the population has settled along the west coast which comprises flat, plain terrain (Chang 2008), which was home to almost all <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning grounds in Taiwan (Hsieh and Chen 2015). On Taiwan Island, habitat destruction resulting from landfill projects and the construction of breakwaters and fishing ports has led to the loss of 55% of the natural coastline, particularly of intertidal areas on the west coast (CPAMI 2007), so almost all <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning grounds have been degraded or lost (Hsieh and Chen 2015). On Kinmen, horseshoe crabs were historically afforded some protection because they were located in restricted military zones (Hsieh and Chen 2009). However, as restrictions were relaxed, the major threat to <em>T. tridentatus</em> on Kinmen was habitat loss due to the construction of a commercial port on spawning and nursery grounds in 1997 through reclamation of intertidal flats and dredging of subtidal areas, destroying the ecological integrity of the whole bay (Hsieh and Chen 2015).<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, early maps showed uninterrupted coastlines, natural streams, pristine beaches and extensive and undisturbed mudflats, and the historic widespread occurrence of horseshoe crabs may be indicated indirectly from the names of some locations such as Hau Dei (Ground for Horseshoe Crabs) and Hau Hok Wan (Horseshoe Crab Carapace Bay), but Hau Dei was reclaimed in the 1960’s and is now part of a market town (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014). No juvenile or adult horseshoe crabs have been observed at Hau Hok Wan in recent years (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Major reclamation projects since the 1970’s resulted in entire suites of <em>T. tridentatus</em> habitats disappearing (Shin et al. 2009), including the habitat at Nim Wan, where juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> were previously found, but which was developed as a landfill site in 1993.<br/><br/>Horseshoe crabs in Indonesia face a series of common threats, including land reclamation of spawning habitats and nursery grounds, houses built along spawning beaches, mangrove loss and degradation, and a high utilization rate of spawning areas and nursery grounds (Meilana <em>et al</em>. 2015), whilst in Palawan, Philippines all sandy shore lines in the vicinity of Puerto Princesa City have been subject to coastal construction (Schoppe 2002).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Impingement of Coastal Infrastructure</strong><br/><br/>The slow growth of the juveniles and their long life span on the shores make them highly susceptible to direct loss of habitat through construction of coastal defences, such as seawalls and reclamation works and disturbances caused by urban developments in the vicinity of these spawning/nursery shores (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Modifications of the hydrography of nearby waterways from coastal developments can also adversely affect the return of adult horseshoe crabs to the shores for spawning, thus resulting in less recruitment and decrease in juvenile populations (Sekiguchi and Shuster 2009).<br/><br/>In Japan, artificial coastlines rapidly increased in the 1960s and 1970s. The length of coastlines, where banks, revetments and other protection structures were developed, reached about 10,000 km, accounting for about 30% of the total length of the country’s coastline. Meanwhile, the length of natural coastlines which do not have artificial structures decreased to about 50% of the total length of coastlines by 1998 (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 15). As reported in Itow (1993), around the Seto Inland Sea the construction of landfills and revetments has caused habitat deterioration through the loss of silt and mud from some tidal flats, turning them into pebble beaches, making it impossible for juvenile horseshoe crabs to survive in these areas.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, horseshoe crabs are also facing habitat deterioration due to construction of dikes close to their spawning grounds (Hsieh and Chen 2015). For example, the extirpation of <em>T. tridentatus</em> at Budai, one of the last spawning habitats and nursery grounds on the west coast of Taiwan Island was believed to have been caused by the blocking of the Longgong Estuary by an expansion of Budai Harbour in 2004 (Yang et al. 2009), construction of sea walls adjacent to the Haomeiliao Nature Reserve and excessive opening of fish ponds (BirdLife International 2001). Such alterations in land use contributed to changing the local hydrology so that the sandy substrate that comprised the juvenile nursery ground was replaced by the deposition of a muddy substrate instead (Laurie/Yang 2017, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Even small-scale infrastructure projects can have significant impacts, such as the construction of coastal footpaths and piers at Nim Shue Wan and Lai Chi Wo in Hong Kong (Laurie 2014, 2016 pers. obs). Such footpaths and piers cover high tide spawning locations or bisect intertidal flats and can cause profound effects to the local hydrology and sedimentology, resulting in the extirpation of once thriving juvenile populations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Coastal Modification and Mariculture</strong><br/><br/>In Viet Nam, marine and coastal waters support the livelihoods of approximately 20 million people and demand for fisheries-related products has placed increasing pressure on already over-exploited natural stocks. This has resulted in further aquaculture expansion which has caused a continuous decline in the quality of intertidal areas, mangroves and sea grass ecosystems and points towards future “coastal desertification” (Viet Nam NBSAP 2015). Mangrove degradation has been significant, leading to areas of natural mangrove almost completely disappearing through destruction or conversion to aquaculture to support shrimp farming, whilst mangrove afforestation has increased on tidal flats, to support shellfish aquaculture, with vast areas of intertidal estuaries dwindling in size due to the construction of clam ponds. In 1943, Vietnam had more than 408,500 ha of mangroves, by 1990, the area was about 255,000 ha, declining to 209,741 ha in 2006, 140,000 ha in 2010, so that by the end of 2012 only 131,520 ha of mangrove forests remained. Of the remainder, 56% are considered as “planted mangroves” and therefore of low ecological value (Vietnam NBSAP 2015). In parallel, sea-grass bed coverage across Vietnam has decreased from between 40 to 70% according to area, with a suite of three nationally recognized sites losing over 50% of their coverage between 2009 and 2014, some of which was due to water degradation as a result of mariculture development. The coastal sandy ecosystem, a typical ecosystem of Vietnam’s central coastal provinces, has also been remarkably changed, so that its ecosystem service functions, including preventing sand movement, protecting against coastal erosion and maintaining fresh water quality, are now severely diminished. From Vietnam NBSAP (2015), older statistics recorded the area of the coastal sandy ecosystem between Ha Tinh and Ninh Thuan as 85,100 ha, but since 1999 activities such as shrimp farming, sea sand mining and tourism infrastructure construction have destroyed thousands of hectares of the coastal sandy ecosystem in the central provinces.<br/><br/>In certain areas of its range, intertidal mudflats have been converted to oyster cultivation. In Taiwan on Kinmen Island (Chen 2009) and Hong Kong (Morton and Lee 2010), a traditional method of oyster farming involves bottom planting using rock plates, concrete stakes or large stones deployed in rows as protruding arrays on intertidal flats, which have created obstacles for adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> when they move toward high tide zones for spawning (Chen 2009). Furthermore, studies in Hong Kong have demonstrated where oyster cultivation occurs, juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> avoid the areas with cultivated oyster beds, including the significant areas of debris which have been created through the harvesting of oysters (Morton and Lee 2010, Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Sand and Gravel Extraction</strong><br/><br/>The use of sea sand and gravel to support reclamation is a common practice in Asia. In the Seto Inland Sea, Japan the disappearance of sandbanks caused by sea gravel extraction may have led to a decrease in the populations of cornerstone species in the food chain (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 15), and sea sand mining for supplying material for concrete is considered to be one of the factors contributing to the destruction of adult horseshoe crabs habitats there (Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2015) and of adult horseshoe crab habitat in Kasaoka in Okayama Prefecture (Seino 2011).<br/><br/>Sand or gravel extraction can not only have a biological impact, leading to a change in benthic communities, it can also change a stable area of seabed into an area of erosion and if undertaken where currents are not strong, this can lead to the preferential erosion and deposition of fine sediments from surrounding areas through a winnowing effect, to replace the sometimes coarser sediment that has been extracted (Desprez 2000). This is what appears to have happened in China, where sea sand extraction has been identified as a significant cause of the degradation of <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning beaches along China’s tropical and sub-tropical southeast coast between its border with Vietnam and latitude 28°N, corresponding with the border of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces (UNDP 2000) which encompasses most of <em>T. tridentatus</em> range along the coast of China. It has also been identified as a primary cause of degradation in the Dongshan-Nan’ao migratory species corridor between Fujian and Guangdong (Ferguson and Wang 2009), it is implicated in the degradation of <em>T. tridentatus </em>habitats at Budai, Taiwan (BirdLife International 2001), in the degradation of adult, sub-adult and juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> habitats at Kinmen Island, Taiwan (Laurie/Yang 2017, pers. comm.) and of <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning beaches and intertidal juvenile nursery grounds at Puerto Princesa in Palawan, Philippines (Schoppe 2002).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Habitat Disturbance</strong><br/><br/>Throughout Asia, many <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning and nursery grounds are either situated next to population centres or are easily accessible and popular locations for a variety of activities, including in China (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012), Hong Kong (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016), Philippines (Schoppe 2002), Malaysia (Robert <em>et al</em>. 2014, Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Indonesia (Meilana <em>et al</em>. 2015). From a home range study in analysis of area utilization, juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> were noted to exhibit limited residential and nomadic movement patterns, which might be associated with the distribution of food patches on the mudflat (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2015b). These results indicate the restricted movements of juveniles and suggest their potential for high susceptibility to localized habitat disturbance.<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, as well as oyster farming and traditional fishing with erected nets across the shoreline, unregulated and uncontrolled recreational activities including clam digging, shellfish collection and sunset watching have caused considerable damage to nursery grounds in intertidal areas, including <em>H. beccarii</em> seagrass beds where juvenile horseshoe crabs forage (HKBSAP Report 2014,<strong> </strong>Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similar threats have been reported in Palawan, Philippines (Schoppe 2002), Sabah, Malaysia (Robert <em>et al</em>. 2014, Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Indonesia (Meilana <em>et </em>al. 2015), whilst intense fishing activities in the Menggatal River, Malaysia for subsistence and commercial harvest of a myriad of species including bivalves and gastropods (Robert et al. 2014) may lead to a substantial decrease in these major dietary components of horseshoe crabs.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Water Quality and Pollution Events</strong><br/><br/>In Japan, several studies have suggested that the susceptibility of eggs and embryos to pollutants is a contributing factor in the decline or extinction of local <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations (Botton 2001, p. 46). This is especially so along the coasts of the heavily industrialized Seto Inland Sea, where up to 42% of embryos from some locations were found to be malformed. Pollution in Japan appears to be having a greater impact on <em>T. tridentatus </em>than on <em>L. polyphemus</em> in the United States. The reasons for this are not clear, but <em>T. tridentatus</em> could be more sensitive to pollutants than <em>L. polyphemus</em>, or it could be the types and levels of contaminants in Japan are especially harmful (Botton and Itow 2009). The long incubation period of <em>T. tridentatus</em> of about 43 days from insemination to hatching (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 148) and the choice of spawning location along the high tide line (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 54) may lead to such high malformation incidences.<br/><br/>Apart from having a direct impact on eggs, pollution may also cause abnormalities during the process of egg formation in the mothers’ body, after polluting materials enter the mothers’ system from ingesting polluted silt or feeding on polluted prey, transferring environmental contaminants to the eggs before they are laid (Botton and Itow 2009). Another associated issue may be a decrease in prey animals due to the effects of pollution, so it is possible that healthy egg formation may be inhibited by lack of sufficient nourishment in the environment. Itow (1993) suggested the major source of pollution responsible for causing these abnormalities is believed to be from landfills, although the run-off of agricultural chemicals may also have had an impact.<br/><br/>Adverse impacts of poor water quality and changes in local hydrology on horseshoe crab habitats are also apparent. In 1928, Oe-Hama Beach, Kasaoka, Japan was designated as a ‘Horseshoe Crab Spawning Ground National Monument’, but despite this protection, the area was drained during the ‘Kasaoka Bay Land Reclamation Project’, a large-scale land reclamation which commenced in 1969 (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 40; Tsuchiya 2009, p. 559). After this, a sandy area along the Konoshima Channel was designated a protected breeding place for <em>T. tridentatus</em>, but in parallel the channel became the only passage for wastewater from Kasaoka City, resulting in rapid pollution and a corresponding decrease in horseshoe crab populations (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 41; Botton 2001, p. 45).<br/><br/>Also, before land reclamation, seawater exchange occurred in Kasaoka Bay due to tidal currents passing through the opening of the bay and the Konoshima Channel. However, this seawater exchange was cut off by land reclamation, resulting in the deterioration of water quality and Kasaoka Bay became uninhabitable for many marine organisms. The large-scale alteration of the bay shape has modified local hydrology and exerted a distinct effect on the wave field and tidal currents in the area, leading to changes in overall habitats of horseshoe crabs. As a result, sand was transported and deposited along the shores of Kasaoka Bay by littoral drift, causing the formation of some new spawning sites and the loss of others, especially where beaches became unsuitable because of a lack of wave action to stir and sort the surface sediments. The subsequent accumulation of fine materials remaining near the sand surface thus prevented sufficient exchange of groundwater around the eggs (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p.12).<br/><br/>Another consequence of the narrowing of the Konoshima Channel was that the wake from passing ships was not only affecting the distribution of sand along the shorelines but at certain times also swamping the spawning locations along the high tide line (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 6). The size and speed of ocean going vessels have increased in recent years, resulting in abnormally large waves repeatedly surging onto beaches, which has changed their nature, making them unsuitable for spawning. If ships are passing during a spawning event, the waves generated may also interfere with the egg laying act itself (Itow 1993).<br/><br/>In China, environmental pollution caused by anthropogenic activities (China NBSAP 5 2014) has been cited as one of the causes of <em>T. tridentatus</em> population declines (Xie and Weng 2011) and in Vietnam, pollution-related horseshoe crab die-offs have been observed (Laurie/Do 2014, pers. comm.). In Hong Kong, illegal pollution discharges into <em>T. tridentatus </em>spawning streams have been observed to be timed to coincide with mainly night time maximum high tides (Laurie 2009, 2011, 2013, pers. obs.), which may not only affect deposited eggs, but also coincides with the peak time when planktonic larvae choose to move from the spawning location to the intertidal area (Sakemi 1997; Botton 2001, p. 47).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Invasive Species</strong><br/><br/>In recent years, <em>T. tridentatus</em> nursery grounds on Kinmen, Taiwan have been lost to the invasive smooth cordgrass <em>Spartina alterniflora </em>(Hsieh and Chen 2015) and the <em>H. beccari</em> seagrass beds and tidal flats at Ha Pak Nai/Pak Nai in Hong Kong are being encroached upon by the common cordgrass <em>Spartina anglica</em>&#160;(HKBSAP Report 2014).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Climate Change</strong><br/><br/>Horseshoe crabs have proven resilience. They have survived five mass extinction events, numerous minor extinction events (Tanacredi 2001 p. 2, Rudkin and Young 2009 p. 41) and lived in geological periods which have experienced significant climate extremes (Zachos <em>et al </em>2001, Moritz and Agudo 2013). However, <em>T. tridentatus</em> is now facing the threats of climate change with severely depleted populations throughout much of its range, which pose two obvious threats to its populations: loss of spawning habitat due to rising sea levels and rising temperatures (Arkema <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em>Rising sea levels</em><br/>Sea-level rise will increase the risk of flooding of spawning habitats and, in turn, the rate at which these habitats disappear, including increasing the likelihood that spawning habit becomes compressed between the rising sea and existing housing and other infrastructure (Loveland and Botton 2015). This is a recognized risk in Asia, because many <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning sites and nursery beaches are shared with resident human populations (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012b, Kwan et al. 2016, Schoppe 2002). At the extreme, in Japan, spawning habitats such as Tatara Beach, a 16 m by 28 m (448 m<sup>2</sup>) patch located where a breakwater meets a sea-wall (Sekiguchi 1988, Fig. IV-10, p. 62) already requires periodic replenishment to maintain the sand (Botton 2001, p. 45) and like many spawning habitats in Japan is now conservation-reliant, depending on human support for its continued functioning.<br/><br/><em>Rising temperatures</em><br/>Many aspects of <em>T. tridendatus</em> biology and ecology are temperature influenced. Spawning is seasonal and temperature triggered (Nishii 1975), so increasing water temperatures, particularly in its sub-tropical range, could extend the spawning period.<br/><br/>Eggs and trilobite larvae are the two lifestyle stages most at risk from elevated temperatures and whilst the Earth’s average annual temperature has increased at a steady pace in recent decades, global warming has increased the severity of the hottest month and day of the year (Diffenbaugh <em>et al</em>. 2017), with an alarming jump in the severity of the hottest days of the year during the same period. This results in short-term, extreme-heat events whose lethal effects are being caused by exposure to high ambient environmental temperatures (Papalexiou <em>et al</em>. 2018), and it is these events, more than gradual temperature rises, which are most likely to impact eggs and trilobite larvae.<br/><br/>Eggs are deposited along the high tide line, where the covering sand is periodically exposed to sub-aerial temperatures. Optimal water temperatures for incubating eggs range from 22– 31°C in Japan (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1988 p. 67) to 28-31.8°C in Taiwan (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2004). Hence, if eggs are subject to temperatures outside of these ranges, the risk of non-incubation or mortality will increase.<br/><br/>Trilobite larvae initially develop in their nest area, before moving to the inner shores of their natal beaches to develop (Kawahara 1982, Yeh 1999, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011b). Both of these areas are periodically subjected to tide induced sub-aerial exposure, sometimes for extended periods of time, increasing the risk that these larvae will be subject to elevated levels of thermal stress. This may result in higher mortality as temperatures suddenly rise.<br/><br/>Juvenile foraging activity varies with latitude and climate, the emergence of juveniles and ecdysis being temperature related (Lee and Morton 2005, Morton and Lee 2010), so that rising temperatures could result in extended foraging seasons, resulting in juveniles taking a shorter time to reach sexual maturity, because they can moult more frequently at higher sediment or water temperatures (Lee and Morton 2005).<br/><br/>Adult horseshoe crabs have wide ranges of thermal tolerance (Mayer 1914), so the impact of rising sea temperatures on <em>T. tridentatus</em> is unlikely to pose a direct major threat to their survival and their exposure to elevated sub-aerial temperatures is likely to be limited, due to their spawning in the intertidal zone (Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2016), or their spawning during nocturnal flood tides (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 58). However, indirect threats could result.<br/><br/>It is assessed the 490 dead adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> that were found on the shores of the Kitakyushu/Sonehigata tidal flat in Japan between January and August 2016 (Takahashi 2016) could be victims of rising sea temperatures. According to the Fukuoka Fisheries and Marine Technology Research Center's Buzen Sea Laboratory, the temperature of the Buzen Sea off of the tidal flats from May through August 2016 was between 0.9-1.6° C higher than in a typical year (Takahashi 2016). It is believed the horseshoe crabs had succumbed to predation by the Naru Eagle Ray, <em>Aetobatus narutobiei </em>(Kabutogani Jimankan Museum 2016), whose range could have been extended due to warming seas.<br/><br/>Apart from threatening <em>T. tridentatus</em>, rising temperatures also pose a threat to its supporting food chain, including seagrass beds as well as the intertidal meiofauna which comprises its trilobite larvae and juvenile prey. In Japan, some of the 40% reduction in area of seagrass beds from the 1970s to 2000s is believed to have been caused by rising sea temperature (Japan NBSAP 2014, p. 15).<br/><br/><em>Country impacts</em><br/>Viet Nam recognizes it is likely to be one of the countries most impacted by climate change. Under current climate change scenarios, Viet Nm is predicted to house fragmented ecosystems that will undergo a high rate of loss of biological diversity resources compounding its vulnerability to climate change (Vietnam NBSAP 2015). It is because climate change combined with the degradation and depletion of forests of key watersheds can change the use of water resources, which may lead to more frequent floods, flash floods and landslides and cause heavy damage to the environment, all of which can adversely impact on coastal ecosystems. In addition, Vietnam’s main delta areas are likely to be severely impacted through sea level rise, leading to the loss of significant areas of coastal habitat (Vietnam NBSAP 2015).<br/><br/><em>Land subsidence</em><br/>An issue linked to rising sea levels, which leads to flooding but not factored in to many assessments, is land subsidence. This is being recognized an emerging issue in Asia. On Taiwan Island, serious submergence of the ground layer of the southwest coastline and rising sea levels due to global weather changes have contributed to an increase in coastal infrastructure, inundation of sea water and shoreline erosion (CPAMI 2010). A total of 1,150 km² of the coastal region, representing 3.2% of the total land area, has been prone to seawater flooding due to land subsidence (Chang 2008), which has undoubtedly contributed to <em>T. tridentatus</em> habitat loss. This threat to <em>T. tridentatus</em> habitats exists elsewhere, but has yet to be quantified.</p>","The population is split into a series of genetically distinct subpopulations across the range of <em>T. tridentatus</em> (for a full discussion of genetic diversity and dispersal patterns, see the 'Population' section in the Supplementary Information).<br/>A number of factors may contribute to the presence of subpopulations in <em>T. tridentatus</em>. In terms of its ecology, <em>T. tridentatus</em> exhibits limited larval dispersal (Botton and Loveland 2003), confined juvenile mobility (Kawahara 1982, Kaiser 2002, Almendral and Schoppe 2005, Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2015b), limited adult movement (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2016) and spawning beach fidelity (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chan <em>et al</em>. 2016, unpublished), which may all be factors contributing to observed patterns of local genetic variation.<br/><u>Peninsulas</u><br/>Where noticeable genetic differentiation has been detected, it may be due to geographic separation due to peninsulas including the differences in the eastern and western populations in Japan, separated by the Itoshima Peninsula (Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2015) or differences in the Beihai and Zhanjiang populations, separated by the Leizhou Peninsula in southwest China (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Enclosed Bays</u><br/>Another geographic factor influencing genetic differentiation appears to be the geographic isolation of populations in enclosed bays leading to restricted gene flow. Examples of this type of isolation include the population in Hirao Bay in the eastern Japan group, which exhibit unique genetic features when compared with neighbouring sites (Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2015), the limited genetic diversity in the Tiexianwei population in the semi-enclosed Magong Bay in Taiwan (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2007), the genetic differentiation seen in the Zhangpu population from the large but semi-enclosed Dangshan Bay in China (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2013), and the low haplotype diversity observed in populations on the enclosed north western coast of Lantau Island in Hong Kong (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2016, unpublished). In terms of bathymetrics, South-east Asia comprises shallow marginal seas, island arcs and marine basins bounded by deep sea trenches (Hutchinson 1986, 1989) and it is important to note, this underwater ‘topography’ is equally, if not more important in limiting aquatic dispersal, but in respect of <em>T. tridentatus</em> this potential limitation has not yet been tested.<br/><br/>At the extreme end of the range, the presence of the population at Budai, Taiwan with a single haplotype and no genetic diversity is indicative of a population on the verge of extinction (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2009a).<br/><br/>The limited dispersal potential and the subdivision of at least some <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations to local embayments parallels the documented population structure in the American Horseshoe Crab (<em>Limulus polyphemus</em>), especially in the northern and southern portions of its geographic range (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><u><strong>Population Trends<br/></strong></u>Data availability determined whether quantitative analysis was valid for trend estimation. In the absence of a quantitative analysis, descriptive summaries of observations were included to infer qualitative trends in relative abundance and distribution (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2016). Population trends are here assessed comparing previous records, which usually involve mortalities together with recent survey data. <br/><br/><u>Japan<br/></u>There is a consensus among Japanese scientists that <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations have decreased precipitously throughout Japan since the 1950s and populations within the Seto Inland Sea, where they were once common are almost extinct (Botton 2001, p. 44; Nagasaki Prefecture 2001; Iwaoka and Okayama 2009, p. 581). The word ‘decimation’ has been used to describe these declines (Botton 2001, p. 48). In particular, <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once abundant on all of the coasts of the Seto Inland Sea, but coastal change due to human activities has resulted in habitat loss, leading to reduced ranges and reduced populations (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 39).<br/><br/>During the reclamation of Tomioka Bay in 1958, the remains of approximately 10,000 adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> were found stranded (Nishii 1973, Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 8) whilst when Kasaoka Bay was reclaimed commencing in 1969, approximately 100,000 adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> and millions of juvenile horseshoe crabs were believed to have perished (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 8).<br/><br/>In the 1970s, it is estimated that the spawning <em>T. tridentatus</em> population at Tatara Beach (a protected horseshoe crab breeding area in Imari Bay on northern Kyushu) may have been 500 pairs (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 44). Surveys conducted at Tatara Beach during the 1979 and 1980 peak spawning season recorded a daily peak count of 23 pairs on one day at diurnal high tide, with normally fewer than 20 pairs spawning at any one time, with the largest number of spawning pairs being recorded during a season being less than 30 pairs. A maximum number of 48 spawning pairs were recorded on 22 July 1982 during a night high tide (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 63-64), whilst a similar survey at the same location in 1994 recorded a total of 29 mated pairs, with a daily peak count of five pairs on two consecutive days (Botton <em>et al</em>. 1996).<br/><br/>Sone Tidal Flat is 517 hectares (5.17 km²) when exposed and hosts the largest juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> intertidal nursery ground in Japan. Annual surveys from 1995 to 2013 recorded 120 pairs in 1995 to a maximum of 1581 pairs in 2005, with fluctuating counts, ranging from 513 pairs in 2006; 265 pairs in 2007; 738 pairs in 2012; and 1,079 pairs in 2013 (Hayashi 2015). In 2016, the adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> population was estimated to be around 2,400 individuals at the Sone-Higata tidal flat according to the Fukuoka branch of the Horseshoe Crab Preservation Society of Japan (Nihon Kabutogani o Mamoru Kai) (Takahashi 2016).<br/><br/>In Japan, cooperation has been sought from fishermen to assist in horseshoe crab research by reporting or contributing their catches. Between 2002 and 2005, fishermen at three locations of the Kujukushima Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture reported their catches year-round. During this period, 81 adults were caught, with most being collected between May and October, which covered the pre-spawning, peak-spawning and post-spawning periods (Iwaoka and Okayama 2009, pp. 577–578. Table 1, p. 578).<br/><br/>Between 1999 and 2016, annual <em>T. tridentatus</em> surveys including records of offshore capture by fishermen and intertidal surveys at known spawning sites were conducted in Etajima and Takehara cities in Hiroshima Prefecture. At Takehara City, during intertidal surveys, a total of seven adults were recorded, including one amplexed spawning pair in 2015, two amplexed spawning pairs and a single adult female in 2016. The maximum number of juveniles observed at one time during these surveys was 46 individuals in April 2016. At Etajima City, 37 adults were recorded in the study period, with a maximum count of 15 individuals in 2008 whilst 40 juveniles were recorded, with a maximum count of 16 individuals in 2008 and spawning was observed once in 2000 (Ohtsuka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Laurie/Ohtsuka 2018, pers. comm, Laurie/Nishihara 2018, pers. comm.). Both populations are nearly extinct (Laurie/Ohtsuka 2018, pers. comm).<br/><br/>In parallel, a continuous monitoring survey of known <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning sites conducted on the Tsuyazaki coast in Fukuoka Prefecture reported a decrease in spawning pairs from 139 pairs recorded in 2005, to 70 pairs in 2006, 45 pairs in 2007 and 40 pairs in 2008 (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2010), a 70% reduction in three years. The decreases are believed to be due to habitat degradation caused by coastal development in the area.<br/><br/><u>China<br/></u><em>Nationally</em>:&#160; In the 1970s <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once widely distributed and abundant along the southeast coast of China, below the Yangtze River with high population densities (Sekiguchi 1988, Hong 2011). It could be found ‘throughout the seas’ and was regarded as an important economic species, but subsequently it suffered significant population declines (Liao and Ye 2000; China Species Red List 2009a,b; Li and Hu 2011; Hong 2011, p. 153; Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012b).<br/><br/><em>Fujian Province</em>:&#160; Xiamen was a major locality for <em>T. tridentatus</em>, where they could be seen all along the beaches at high tide in the spawning season, from May to September and in the 1970s, it was always easy to find them in the coastal waters around Xiamen (Hong 2011, p. 153). They were easy to catch, from the high tide line to water 5 m deep, where they could be found by following their bubbles. Artisanal fishermen could easily catch 50 to 60 pairs at a time, amounting to overall productivity of 5,000 pairs or more a year (Hong 2011, p. 160). However, interviews with fishermen, field surveys and other research undertaken between 2002 and 2004 revealed that <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations had decreased sharply after the 1970s and had become scarce (Hong 2011, pp. 159-161).<br/><br/>Pingtan in Fujian was once reputed to have the largest population of <em>T. tridentatus</em> on the coast of China, but the population has since experienced dramatic declines (Huang 2011). Huang <em>et al</em>. (2002) also reported that in the 1970s, the productivity of the horseshoe crab fishery in Pingtan was reduced by approximately 80 to 90% compared to the 1950s and by the 1990s there were not enough individuals to support the local fishery. Based on official records kept by the Pingtan Ocean and Aquatic Bureau, the estimated productivity of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in the Pingtan area was 15,000 pairs in 1984; 9,500 pairs in 1995; 3,700 pairs in 1998; and 1,000 pairs in 2002 (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2002), representing a reported fisheries capture decline of 93% between 1984 to 2002. This is on top of the 80 to 90% declines experienced between the 1950’s and 1990’s, representing a shifting baseline in estimates.<br/><br/>Another site in Fujian where <em>T. tridentatus</em> abounded up to the early 1980s was the seas around Dongshan Island (Mikkelsen 1988 p. 70), but surveys between 2006 and 2010 observed no spawning and only recorded the presence of juvenile populations (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012b).<br/><br/>Field surveys and interviews with local fishermen in previously healthy horseshoe crab habitats in 2005 and 2006 in Fujian by Weng <em>et al</em>. (2007) revealed <em>T. tridentatus</em> was extirpated at Qianqi in Fuding County and Shandu Island in Ningde City, whilst spawning horseshoe crabs were no longer seen on beaches at Huangcuo in Xiamen City, Meizhou Island in Putian City or on Pingtan Island. In July 2015, surveys of the benthic macrofauna in the sandy intertidal zone of Shanqi and Tannan Bay in the Chinese Horseshoe Crab Reserve in Pingtan Island, Fujian failed to find any evidence for the presence of adult or juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> (Li <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><em>Guangdong Province</em>:&#160; In the 1980s, it was estimated up to 1,500,000 <em>T. tridentatus</em> pairs were distributed in Guangdong waters, particularly around the Leizhou Peninsula (Hong 2011, p. 208) but by 1990, this was reduced to between 600,000 to 700,000 pairs (Hong 2011, p. 154). Since then, <em>T. tridentatus</em> are difficult to find around the Pearl River delta (Hong 2011, p. 153) and one of the justifications for establishing a conservation zone in the Shantou Tidal Zone Wetland included the identification of <em>T. tridentatus</em> as a ‘rare species’ (UNEP 2005).<br/><br/><em>Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region</em>:&#160; In Guangxi, prior to the 1980s, mass spawning of <em>T. tridentatus</em> was frequently encountered on the shores of Beibu Gulf (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012b) and according to fishermen, before the 1990s, <em>T. tridentatus</em> were common in Guangxi, being widely distributed and abundant and seen everywhere, but after the 1990s they were rare to see (Hong 2011, p. 202).<br/><br/>Oceanic research reports estimated populations in excess of 600,000 to 700,000 <em>T. tridentatus</em> pairs in Beibu Gulf before the 1990s (Hong 2011, p. 154), but by the late 1990s these had dropped to 300,000 pairs or less (Liao and Li 2001; Hong 2011, p. 202). Historically, up to 1,000,000 pairs of adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> may have been exploited in Beibu Gulf to satisfy the demand for consumption and biomedical applications (Liao and Ye 2000, Li and Hu 2011) and according to Professor Guangyao Liang of the Guangxi Oceanic Research Institute, the output of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Guangxi dropped by 90% between 1990 and 2000 largely because of human consumption (People’s Daily 2000).<br/><br/>Because adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> are so rarely encountered, surveys are now conducted on juveniles in Guangxi. In 2009, a survey of three intertidal mudflats in Guangxi (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011) recorded 1,742 juveniles at Xi Bei Ling, with a distribution of 1.79 individuals/100 m², 2,753 juveniles at Jin Hai Wai, with a distribution of 3.19 individuals/100 m² and 441 juveniles at Xi Cheng, with a distribution of 0.88 individuals/100 m².<br/><br/>By 2014, it was estimated populations of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Beibu Gulf had decreased by over 90% and about 10% of the remaining adults were being harvested annually. The local biomedical industry estimated that over 80% of the harvested <em>T. tridentatus</em> were being consumed as food and 20% were being bled to produce Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (TAL) (Fauna and Flora International 2014). Such a decline was supported by responses to a survey in September 2015 of 407 respondents from 29 communities along Beibu Gulf (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2017). Elder respondents recalled commonly seeing <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning on the shores when they were younger, but almost all respondents had noted an overall reduction in <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations, with the average daily harvest of adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> declining sharply from an approximate range of around 50 to 1,000 individuals in the 1990s to 0 to 30 individuals by 2015. Nearly all respondents opined there had been an overall reduction in the abundance of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in the previous five years.<br/><br/><em>Hainan Province</em>: Up to the early 1980s, <em>T. tridentatus</em> could be found in major concentrations on the west coast of Hainan (Mikkelsen 1988. p. 71; Sekiguchi 1988. p. 34) and before the 1990s, it was estimated up to 300,000 pairs of <em>T. tridentatus</em> were distributed in the seas to the north of Hainan (Hong 2011, p. 154).<br/><br/>From 2006 to 2010, interviews with fishermen and surveys were conducted at 27 nationally recognized <em>T. tridentatus</em> spawning sites on the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Fishermen reported populations had decreased greatly in most of the coasts surveyed, no spawning was observed at the 27 sites, a few juveniles were found at only 6 of the 27 sites and no ‘new recruit’ Instar I to Instar III juveniles were found at Longkou in Dongshan Bay in Fujian. Such data indicate that <em>T. tridentatus</em> had almost disappeared from much of its range in China, with the exception of Dongshan Bay in Fujian, where over 1,000 juveniles were found and Beibu Bay in Guangxi. By 2004, it was nationally recognized that <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations had seriously declined due to over-exploitation (China Species Red List 2009b), such that it was considered to be on the brink of extinction in Chinese waters (Xie and Weng 2011) and in need of urgent protection (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012b).<br/><br/><u>Taiwan</u><br/><em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> was once widespread and abundant along the west coast of Taiwan Island, in the Penghu Islands and Kinmen with thriving populations, as attested to by evidence from historical records, literature, colloquial language, daily usage and place names (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Chen and Chen 2011), but populations in Taiwan are declining (Hsieh and Chen 2015). No individual adults or mating adult pairs have been recorded from the intertidal flats of the Taiwan Island coast since the 1960s, nor more recently from Kinmen Island (Hsieh and Chen 2015). However, over the past decade, each year there have been occasional reports of adult horseshoe crabs being landed at fishing wharfs in Taiwan (maximum four or five individuals ever documented from each report), suggesting the adult population in the waters surrounding Taiwan is limited.<br/>&#160;<br/>Because adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> are so uncommon, surveys have been conducted on juveniles in Taiwan. In 2003, surveys over several weeks on the Penghu Islands found only 20 juveniles (Hsieh and Chen 2015) and on Taiwan Island a small population of juveniles was documented at the Haomeiliao Nature Reserve on the Longgong River Estuary in Budai, Chiayi County between 2004 and 2005. However, none have been found there since 2007 (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2009b), whilst one juvenile was reported from Xiangshan intertidal flat at Hsinchu City in Taiwan Island in 2013 (Hsieh and Chen 2015).<br/><br/>Further reported by Hsieh and Chen (2015), a study of juvenile densities at Beishan, Nanshan, Hsiashu on Kinmen between 2003 and 2009 showed rapid and significant declines in the juvenile populations at Nanshan and Hsiashu. Juvenile abundance at Nanshan diminished from 0.18 individuals/m² in 2003 to 0.01 individuals/m² in 2009, whilst at Hsiashu, juvenile abundance declined from 1.02 individuals/m² on average in 2003 to 0.18 individuals/m² on average in 2009. In contrast, the juvenile population at Beishan changed little and fluctuated between 0.37 individuals/m² in 2003 and 0.03 individuals/m² in 2007. Beishan and Nanshan are located within the Kinmen Kuningtou Northwest Intertidal Terrain Horseshoe Crab Conservation Area (Hsieh and Chen 2009) and when data from Beishan and Nanshan are combined, the juvenile density decreased from 0.30 individuals/m² in 2003 to a range from 0.02 to 0.17 individuals/m² from 2004 to 2009. In 2006, the Kinmen Fisheries Research Institute purchased 57 adults from fishermen and 335 individuals in 2007, but no adults were offered by fishermen in 2008, whilst the Penghu Fisheries Research Institute purchased 209 adults from fishermen in 2008. A survey for adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> using drift gillnets over three nights around Penghu Islands in November 2008 only caught two sub-adult males, whilst a separate survey conducted for one day by Kinmen Fisheries Research Institute using bottom trawl nets in 2008&#160; harvested 12 adults (Hsieh and Chen 2015).<br/><br/><em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> is now extirpated at many locations along the west coast of Taiwan Island and between 1998 and 2012 surveys found only scattered juvenile populations left (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2007, Chen 2011, Chang 2012). It is found at two locations on the Penghu Islands, with viable juvenile populations restricted to a number of sites on Kinmen Island, but these populations are declining, even in the Kinmen Kuningtou Northwest Intertidal Terrain Horseshoe Crab Conservation Area, a designated reserve (Hsieh and Chen 2015).<br/><br/><u>Hong Kong</u><br/><em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> was once widespread and abundant throughout Hong Kong waters with thriving populations, as attested to by evidence from anecdotal accounts and place names (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Major concentrations of <em>T. tridentatus</em> could be found in Hong Kong up to the early 1980s (Mikkelsen 1988, p. 71), but populations are declining (Huang <em>et al</em>. 1998, Chiu and Morton 1999, Chiu 2003, Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishermen and older residents recalled <em>T. tridentatus</em> being abundant in Hong Kong. In 1962 a retired police officer remembered seeing ‘hundreds’ of pairs of <em>T. tridentatus</em> on a beach at Lung Kwu Sheung Tan and from the 1960s to 1970s, fishermen in Ha Pak Nai would collect up to 200 <em>T. tridentatus</em> as bycatch in their fishing nets in a single night. There were so many on the mudflats on some days, people had to be careful where they walked, whilst in 1979 another police officer&#160; recalled seeing ‘thousands’ of <em>T. tridentatus</em> covering the beaches on Chep Lap Kok, spread out in long chains as they were mating (Laurie/Various pers. comm).<br/><br/>The historic widespread occurrence of horseshoe crabs in Hong Kong may be indicated indirectly from place names (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and a study of historical distributions of horseshoe crabs through interviews with local fishermen and elderly villagers revealed mating pairs of <em>T. tridentatus</em> were often seen in great numbers on many beaches in Hong Kong during the summer months until the 1980s and adults were evenly distributed throughout the waters of Hong Kong (Chiu and Morton 1999). However, by the early 1990s mating pairs were no longer seen on beaches where they had previously occurred and according to local fishermen in 1998 (Huang <em>et al</em>. 1998), the Pak Nai mudflat used to attract large numbers of spawning <em>T. tridentatus</em> in summer, but few in the last decade.<br/><br/><em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> has since disappeared from much of its range, whilst reclamation has claimed many historic spawning and juvenile nursery grounds and only lesser numbers of individuals can be found in Deep Bay as compared with anecdotal records (Chiu and Morton 1999, Chiu 2003). According to monthly reports related to a marine ecological survey by the Provisional Airport Authority in 1995 (Huang 1997), no horseshoe crabs were collected from the Sha Chau area, adjacent to Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok, although the area was once said to be a thriving habitat for <em>T. tridentatus</em>.<br/><br/>Because adult horseshoe crab densities are very low in the seas around Hong Kong (Li 2008), the visual spawning survey of mating pairs on the shores or sea-bottom trawling of adults used for estimating populations of American Horseshoe Crabs (Ehlinger <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hata and Berkson 2003) are not practical. The last time a mating pair of <em>T. tridentatus</em> was scientifically observed in Hong Kong was at Lung Kwu Sheung Tan in 1986 (Huang <em>et al</em>. 1998, Chiu and Morton 1999). Surveys at wholesale fish markets, seafood restaurants, fish sellers and with local fishermen indicated 332 adult horseshoe crabs, mainly <em>T. tridentatus</em> were caught in Hong Kong waters from 2004 to 2005 (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2009), whilst in a series of studies to investigate the effectiveness of a trawling ban in Hong Kong on demersal fish and crustacean communities, only 13 sub-adults of <em>T. tridentatus</em> were recovered from systematic trawl surveys conducted at 12 sampling sites in three different areas of Hong Kong waters between 2012 and 2015 (Laurie/Tao 2018,&#160; pers. comm). Where fishermen at Ha Pak Nai caught up to 200 <em>T. tridentatus</em> in a single night, they now catch two to three pairs annually (Laurie/Various pers. comm). As adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> are so rare in Hong Kong, population estimates and trends are by necessity based on juvenile surveys (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The first set of quantitative data on juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Hong Kong was reported from a study along the northwestern coastline of the New Territories in 2002 (Morton and Lee 2003), taken as the baseline, followed by surveys in 2004 and 2005 (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2009), 2007 (Morton and Lee 2010) and 2012 to 2014 (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016). In 2002, surveys at four shores in Deep Bay recorded displayed mean juvenile densities from 0.10-1.97 individuals/100 m² (Morton and Lee 2010); in 2004, the same localities displayed mean juvenile densities from 0.08-0.23 individuals/100 m² (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2009); in 2007 from 0.00-0.86 individuals/100 m²&#160; (Morton and Lee 2010); in 2012 from 0.00-1.17 individuals/100 m² (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016) and in 2014 from 0.1-1.97 individuals/100 m² (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Surveys at other localities found similar low mean juvenile densities and from surveys conducted between 2012 and 2014, no ‘new recruit’ Instar I to Instar III juveniles were found throughout Hong Kong (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The presence of small and discrete <em>T. tridentatus</em> juvenile populations on only a few shores in Hong Kong, coupled with relatively few new recruits (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016), slow growth rate and length of time of between 13 to 14 years to reach maturity (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2015), suggest these populations are fragile and vulnerable to local extirpation (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016). In 2016, the population of juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> was estimated to be between 2,100 to 4,300 individuals on all horseshoe crab juvenile nursery grounds in Hong Kong (Kwan <em>et al</em>. 2016), about 60% of which reside on the intertidal mudflats at Pak Nai and Ha Pak Nai (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><u>Viet Nam</u><br/>Up to the early 1980s major concentrations of <em>T. tridentatus</em> could be found along the coast of Viet Nam, at least as far south as Nha-Trang (Mikkelsen 1988), but populations are decreasing. Before 1990 <em>T. tridentatus</em> was commonly found on sand banks in tidal areas and coastal estuaries along the coast of Viet Nam, most abundantly in the Central Coastal Province, but between 1990 and 2007 it is estimated the number of individuals declined by 50%, the area of occupancy in Viet Nam&#160; declined by 50% and harvest yield declined by 20% (Nguyen 2007). Since then, habitat loss has continued unabated (Vietnam NBSAP 2015) and populations have been targeted to supply the TAL industry and consumer markets in China (Laurie/Novitsky pers. comm. 2014, Laurie/Do pers. comm. 2014). <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em>, which was once historically abundant in the Gulf of Tonkin, is now considered endangered because of over-exploitation (Liu 2013).<br/><br/><u>Philippines<br/></u>Historic information suggests <em>T. tridentatus</em> was once widely distributed throughout the Sulu Sea, including on both the west and east shores of Palawan, Danjugan Island on the east coast of Negros Occidental, Tangalan on the northwest coast of Panay, Tigbauan on the south coast of Panay, Cagayancillo in the centre of the Sulu Sea and Turtle Island and Tawitawi in the south of the Sulu Sea (Schoppe 2002). However, <em>T. tridentatus</em> experienced significant declines in population numbers throughout its range in the decades preceding 2000 (Schoppe 2002). <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> was also recorded from Zambales on the east coast of Luzon (Sekiguchi 1988 p 35), but surveys in 2011 failed to find any evidence of its presence there (Nishida 2012b).<br/><br/>In Palawan, surveys conducted between 1999 and 2001 indicated<em> T. tridentatus</em> was present in coastal municipalities extending the length of Palawan including Quezon, Aborlan and El Nido on the west coast and Brookes Point, Espanola, Narra, Puerto Princesa City, Roxas, Dumaran, Araceli, Taytay and the islands of Agutaya, Magsaysay and Cagayancillo (Schoppe 2002). Juvenile nursery beaches have only been studied at San Pedro, Puerto Princesa (Kaiser 2002) and Aventura Beach, Puerto Princesa on the east coast of Palawan (Almendral and Schoppe 2005). It has also been recorded from Busuanga Island in the northern end of the Palawan Island Chain (WWF 2010; Bautista <em>et al</em>. 2016, p. 84).<br/><br/>There is currently no information available on <em>T. tridentatus</em> population trends in the Philippines, although the juvenile populations that have been studied at nursery beaches are small. In an eight-month survey of San Pedro nursery beach between May and December 2001, 374 juveniles were recorded (Dorkas 2002), whilst in a five-month study from June to October 2002 at Aventura Beach, 125 juveniles were recorded (Almendral and Schoppe 2005).<br/><br/><u>Malaysia</u><br/>Most horseshoe crab research in Malaysia has focused on Peninsula Malaysia on the two horseshoe crab species that occur there, <em>T. gigas</em> and <em>Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda</em> (John <em>et al</em>. 2012, Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2015). <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> population studies have only recently commenced in Sabah (Robert <em>et al</em>. 2014, Manca <em>et al</em>. 2017, Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are yet to be systematically undertaken in Sarawak (Laurie/John 2017, pers. comm). As such, the status of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in East Malaysia is still unknown, but anecdotal reports (Manca <em>et al</em>. 2017) and interviews with locals (Laurie/Robert 2014, pers. comm.) suggest the populations are decreasing.<br/><br/>Over the course of an adult survey conducted over four days during daytime of the highest spring tide between April and October 2014, 195 adult individuals as amplexed pairs (98 males; 97 females) were visually located along an 8,000 m stretch of a spawning beach&#160; at Tanjung Limau, Sabah. In the same period, in waters 1 to 3 km off the coast of Inderasabah, Sabah, because no spawning beach could be located, 113 non-spawning adult individuals (80 males; 33 females) were caught using gill nets deployed at up to 10 m depth (Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2016). In another 5-month study of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Tawau conducted from October 2014 to September 2015 using gill nets deployed in waters up to 5 m deep approximately 1 to 3 km from the shore,&#160; 271 adults, representing 267 individuals (188 males; 88 females) with four recaptures were recovered (Manca <em>et al</em>. 2017). From the above two studies, male-biased Operational Sex Ratios (OSR) were recorded, with 2.42:1 at Inderasabah, Sabah (Mohamad <em>et al</em>. 2016) and 2.08:1 at Tawau, Sabah (Manca <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><u>Brunei Darussalam<br/></u>Horseshoe crab studies commenced in 2017 in Brunei Darussalam, so apart from confirming occurrence, there is currently no information available on <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations (Laurie/Marshall 2018, pers. comm.), although because of its small geographic size, it is unlikely significant populations are resident here.<br/><br/><u>Indonesia</u><br/>According to the Biodiversity Action Plan for Indonesia in 1993, all three species of Asian horseshoe crab, <em>T. tridentatus</em>, <em>T. gigas</em> and <em>Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda</em> were considered either Rare (R), Vulnerable (V) or Endangered (E), but were listed as insufficiently known (K) because of lack of information (Indonesia NBSAP 1993, p. 86).<br/><br/>Basic research on horseshoe crabs in Indonesia was conducted from 1990 to 2000, then stopped (Mashar <em>et al</em>. 2017b), when the focus was on <em>T. gigas</em> and <em>C. rotundicauda</em> (Meilana <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recent research has focused on establishing baseline distribution data (Nishida 2012, Mashar <em>et al</em>. 2017a), including identifying population and stock status, locations of spawning grounds, nursery grounds, adult habitat range and rates of exploitation for all three horseshoe crab species, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> (Mashar <em>et al</em>. 2017b). In this respect, <em>T. tridentatus</em> has until recently been understudied in Indonesia and is therefore still listed as insufficiently known (K), but interviews with fishermen on the north coast of Java revealed horseshoe crab catches are declining (Meilana and Fang 2017).<br/><p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"Horseshoe crab fossils are found in deposits ranging from the Palaeozoic to the Cenozoic. The earliest fossil forms date back 475 million years ago (mya) (Van Roy <em>et al</em>. 2010) and by 310 mya the unmistakable horseshoe crab body form was clearly established (Shuster 2001, p. 36). Modern horseshoe crabs have existed for more than 200 million years (Botton and Ropes 1987, Shuster 2001, Tanacredi 2001, Anderson and Shuster 2003, Blazejowski 2015).<br/><br/>There are four extant species of horseshoe crab found in two regions of the world. <em>Limulus polyphemus</em> (Linnaeus 1758), the American Horseshoe Crab, is found along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines of North America ranging from the Gulf of Maine, USA (42°N) to the Yucatán Peninsula, México (19°N) and west to the northcentral Gulf of Mexico, USA (30°N, 88°W). Three species—<em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> (Leach 1819), <em>T. gigas </em>(Müller 1785) and <em>Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda</em> (Latreille 1802)—inhabit the coastal waters of Asia (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 1).<br/><br/>The first formal surveys of the range, abundance and populations of <em>T. tridentatus </em>were conducted between 1975 to 1981 in its southern range and 1980 to 1982 in its northern range (Sekiguchi 1988, pp. 24–45). <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> broadly ranges in distribution from the north to the south (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 34), extending from Japan in a southerly direction through China (Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Guangxi, Hainan), Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippines (Palawan and Sulu Sea), Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia, while <em>T. gigas </em>and <em>C. rotundicauda </em>range from the east to the west (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 35).<br/><br/>All recent horseshoe crabs, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> are limited to relatively narrow areas and their distribution ranges are discontinuous (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 410). During surveys conducted between 1975 and 1982, population densities were highest on the China coast in its northern range, especially in Fujian and on the west coast of Hainan, whilst population densities in its southern range were extremely low (Sekiguchi 1988, pp. 24–25, 34). In the south eastern part of its range <em>T. tridentatus</em> overlaps with both <em>T. gigas</em> and <em>C. rotundicauda</em> (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 28), where the sympatric occurrence of all three species sometimes occurs (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 28, 35; Robert <em>et al</em>. 2014; Mashar <em>et al</em>. 2017a).<br/>A single female <em>T. tridentatus</em> was recorded from Udo Island, Jeju, South Korea in 1979 (Yang and Ko 2015), but because this was not associated with a known spawning or juvenile nursery habitat, it is not considered within the species range occurrence in this assessment. <br/><u><br/></u><strong><u>Northern extent</u></strong>: The northern most range of <em>T. tridentatus </em>is Kasaoka in Okayama Prefecture on Honshu Island in Japan and the Japanese populations represent the northernmost range for <em>T. tridentatus</em>. Spawning habitats are distributed intermittently along the coastal regions of Southern Honshu, Shikoku and Northern Kyushu, with a historic concentration around the Seto Inland Sea (Sekiguchi 1988, pp. 34, 39–45; Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><u><br/></u><strong><u>Southern extent</u></strong>: Horseshoe crabs, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> inhabit the north coast of Java, Indonesia but no horseshoe crabs have been recorded from South Java (Nishida 2012a), the possible reason being the sea south of Java is deep close to shore (Laurie/Meilana 2015, pers. comm.).&#160;<br/><u><br/></u><strong><u>Eastern extent</u></strong>: Manado in North Sulawesi, Indonesia (Sekiguchi 1988, pp. 32, 36; Yamasaki <em>et al</em>. 1988; BKIPM 2012) represents the eastern most occurrence of <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations. The Wallace Line, a boundary separating Asian and Australasian ecozones, may represent a barrier to the significant eastward expansion of <em>T. tridentatus </em>populations (Laurie/Meilana 2015, pers. comm).<br/><u><br/></u><strong><u>Western extent</u></strong>: Sibolga in North Sumatra Province and Padang in West Sumatra Province, Indonesia (Sekiguchi 1988, pp. 30, 36; Yamasaki <em>et al</em>. 1988, Fig. V-21, p. 96) represent the western most occurrences of <em>T. tridentatus</em> populations.<br/><br/><strong></strong>For a more detailed description of the distribution of <em>T. tridentatus</em> within its range states, and the spread of the species through transportation and introductions, see the 'Geographic Range' section in the Supplementary Information.","<strong><u>Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Industries</u><br/><br/><em>Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (TAL)</em></strong><br/>Horseshoe crabs are harvested by the biomedical industry for the manufacture of Amebocyte Lysate, which is used to test for gram-negative bacterial contamination in injectable drugs and implantable medical devices. The LAL test was commercialized in the 1970s and is currently the global standard for screening medical equipment for bacterial contamination (Levin <em>et al</em>. 2003). The studies of the blood-coagulating proteins of horseshoe crabs and their reaction with bacterial endotoxins aroused the interest of Japanese medical and pharmaceutical researchers and in October 1976 a symposium was held at Kasaoka, Japan entitled ‘Contribution of the Horseshoe Crabs to Medical Science’, followed two years later by a similar symposium held in the United States (Cohen 1979).<br/><br/>The global Amebocyte Lysate market is largely supplied from two sources, Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), derived from <em>L. polyphemus</em>, and Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (TAL), derived from <em>T. tridentatus</em>. Whilst blood from <em>L. polyphemus</em> for LAL production in the USA is obtained by collecting adult crabs and extracting a portion of their blood, then releasing them (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2016), the practice in Asia is to drain all of the animals blood resulting in its death (Hong 2011, p. 154; Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm).<br/><br/>There are two TAL producers in Japan: Seikagaku Corporation, which is the parent company of Associates of Cape Cod, USA and Wako Pure Chemical Industries Limited, which is the parent company of Wako Chemical, USA (Laurie/Novitsky pers. comm. 2014). Seikaguku Corporation commercialized a TAL reagent in 1978, but did not pursue a US licence until 1995 (Easter 2003, pp. 129-130). In China, there are eight manufacturers of TAL reagent (Cai <em>et al</em>. 2017). Four of them are Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology in Zhejiang, Xiamen Bioendo Technology (Xiamen Chinese Horseshoe Crab Reagent Manufactory), Fuzhou Xinbei Biochemical (Fuzhou Xinbei Biological Industrial) in Fujian and Zhanjiang Bokang Marine Biological (Zhanjiang A&amp;C Biological), a subsidiary of Charles River Laboratories of the USA in Guangdong.<br/><br/>The over-exploitation and unrestricted capture of <em>T. tridentatus</em> to supply blood to the lysate and biomedical industry is recognized as being a major contributor to significant population declines in China (China Species Red List 2009b, Gauvry 2015, Mizumura <em>et al</em>. 2017). When <em>T. tridentatus</em> is used in the TAL industry, all of the animal’s parts are used, because there is demand for its blood, meat and the chitin in its shell, making <em>T. tridentatus</em> an ‘all parts use animal’ (Hong 2011, p. 154; Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm).<br/><br/>In terms of recent annual usage, in the 2010’s, in Fujian, China a facility on Dongbi Island, Fuqing Bay, Fuzhou held and bled about 40,000 <em>T. tridentatus</em> each year which were sourced from Guangxi, Guandong, Hainan (Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm.) and Viet Nam (Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm.; Laurie/Do 2014, pers. comm.), where they were collected and penned in Beihei. Then when there was enough stock, they were transported to Dongbi by truck. In Guangxi, a lysate factory near Beihei bleeds about 60,000 crabs each year, whereas a facility in Dongxing, Fangchenggang supplies 20,000 to 30,000 pairs to Zhanjiang A&amp;C Biological Ltd, 8,000 pairs to Xinbei and because of their higher price, 20,000 to 30,000 pairs are supplied directly to restaurants. In Hainan, several thousand pairs of crabs are supplied from a holding facility in Danzhou to Zhanjiang Bokang Marine Biological Co. Ltd. in Zhanjiang. All crabs held at these facilities are bled completely, then what remains are processed for sale as food and supply of carapaces for chitin (Laurie/Novitsky 2014, pers. comm). According to the National Institute for Food and Drug Control in Beijing, limuloid resources are exhausted in China (Pei <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, between 1980 and 2001, a Japanese pharmaceutical company set up a clandestine, but legal horseshoe crab bleeding facility, to extract TAL from local populations of <em>T. tridentatus</em>. This facility was set up in a shark fin warehouse and horseshoe crabs were delivered on a daily basis from the local trawling fleet. The crabs were bled dry, then the carcasses were returned to the fishermen for disposal. In parallel with these activities, adult populations of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Hong Kong collapsed, with conservative scientific estimates putting population declines at around 90% (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014). At this time, the Hong Kong trawling fleet comprised approximately 1,200 trawlers, of which about 650 large trawlers mainly operated in Chinese waters, while the remaining 550 small-to-medium size trawlers operated partly or wholly in Hong Kong waters (LegCo 2010). It is therefore likely many of the horseshoe crabs captured to supply this bleeding operation were caught in Chinese waters, contributing to population collapses there.<br/><br/>In the Klong Yai district of Trat Province in Eastern Thailand a horseshoe crab processing factory operates, which in addition to other functions appears to be a <em>T. tridentatus</em> bleeding facility. The horseshoe crabs are sourced from Vietnam and once processed, products are sent abroad (Human Trafficking Organization 2007).<br/><br/>New research into TAL alternatives is being fueled by the realization the current industry is being supported through the unsustainable requirement for raw materials (Mizumura et al. 2017) Although a recombinant Factor C (rFC) based endotoxin test is now available, the industry has been slow to adopt it as an alternative to LAL or TAL (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Chitin</em></strong><br/>Chitin and its derivative chitosan are of considerable interest to the biomedical, food, biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields because of their beneficial properties including biocompatibility, safety, non-toxicity, non-allergenicity and biodegradability, as well as antifungal, antibacterial, antitumor, immune-adjuvant, anti-thrombogenic, anti-cholesteremic and bio-adhesivity capabilities (Younes and Rinaudo 2015). Applications include use as cationic agents for polluted wastewater treatment, agricultural materials, food and feed additives, hypo-cholesterolemic agents, biomedical and pharmaceutical materials, wound-healing materials, blood anticoagulant, anti-thrombogenic and hemostatic materials, cosmetic ingredients, textile, paper, film and sponge sheet materials, chromatographic and immobilizing media, and analytical reagents (Hirano 1996). Horseshoe crab chitin has thus received much attention in particular because of its particular non-toxicity and biodegradability (Balasubramanian and Khan 2007).<br/><br/><u><strong>Consumption and Use</strong></u><br/><br/>In Japan, <em>T. tridentatus</em> is neither used as food nor bait (Botton 2001, p. 44) and historically, there was no target fishery for horseshoe crabs. However, those caught as bycatch were dried and used as compost (Tsuchiya 2009, pp. 560-561).<br/>In the coastal provinces of China, <em>T. tridentatus</em> was historically a popular dish, being regarded as good and rare, and treated as a delicacy. Consumption was limited to the coastal provinces where it was found, due to the lack of transportation networks along the coast, so it was not traditionally consumed elsewhere. The opening up of coastal areas with the construction of roads has made it easier to transport <em>T. tridentatus</em> to new markets, so that considerable quantities are now transported between coastal provinces to meet demand. Furthermore, as it becomes rarer, it is being accorded the status of a culinary ‘treasure’, making it more expensive, and the rarer it becomes, the more sought after it will become, incentivising fishermen to target it as catch (Hong 2011, p. 154).<br/><br/>In Fujian and Guangxi, whilst some <em>T. tridentatus</em> are exploited for medicinal uses, the majority are harvested as food, where <em>T. tridentatus</em> is considered as a delicacy and highly nutritious food. In Guangxi, horseshoe crabs are sold in seafood restaurants, and some cook books and magazines teach people how to cook them and advertise the high nutritional value and good taste of their meat, particularly in soup prepared from them (Li <em>et al</em>. 2011). Surveys of markets and restaurants along the coastal provinces of China in 2006 to 2007 showed that despite being protected at the provincial level, <em>T. tridentatus</em> was widely available and to meet consumer demand in Zhejiang and Fujian, where horseshoe crabs were scarce, the crabs were smuggled across provinces from Guangdong and Guangxi (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, historically horseshoe crabs were consumed on Taiwan Island and Kinmen but as so few adults are now caught, the unpredictable catch can no longer meet the demand of restaurants (Hsieh and Chen 2015).<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, surveys of fish markets between 1995 and 1998 revealed adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> were sourced from local waters, the South China Sea and Indonesia (Chiu and Morton 1999). A further comprehensive market survey was conducted from 2004 to 2005 at wholesale fish markets, seafood restaurants, fish sellers and with local fishermen for information on the source, sale and utilization of adult horseshoe crabs. Of the 1,023 adult horseshoe crabs recorded, mainly comprising <em>T. tridentatus</em>, 691 individuals (68%) were caught in Chinese waters and 332 individuals (32%) were caught in Hong Kong, by shrimp trawlers and occasionally by netting and cage fishing methods. In terms of seasonal variations, more individuals were caught from September to December 2004 than in the remaining months in 2005. About one-third of the horseshoe crabs collected from trawl nets were released after capture, whilst the remaining two-thirds, about 690 individuals, were kept and sold to wholesale fish markets or seafood restaurants in Hong Kong. Of these, 425 (about 62%) were sold for use in Chinese traditional ‘set-free’ rituals, whilst 265 were retained by fish stalls and seafood restaurants, either for use as photographic props as a way to attract customers and for photograph taking by tourists, or they were served as food. ‘Set-free’ rituals are practices by Chinese Buddhist followers who believe if they release live animals back to the wild, they will have relinquished their sins of killing animals in their daily life (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>There is currently no target fishery of horseshoe crabs in Hong Kong, although adults are sometimes caught entangled in fishing nets which are erected across the coastline of some shores, including across river mouths at high tides for harvesting fish, crabs or shrimp (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, horseshoe crabs are not protected, but are recognized as a legally exploitable resource (Nguyen 2007), where they are collected for local consumption and for supplying demand in China, as well as for international trade (Laurie/Do 2014, pers. comm).<br/><br/><u><strong>Targeting of gravid females</strong></u><br/><br/>In artisanal fisheries, gravid females are targeted for their eggs in the Philippines (Schoppe 2002), Indonesia (Meilana <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Sabah in Malaysia, where female-biased harvesting to fulfil high demands from locals and consumers in neighbouring countries may contribute to male-biased OSR (Christianus and Saad 2007, Manca <em>et al</em>. 2015, Laurie/Mohamad 2017, pers. comm).<br/><u><strong>Talisman and other uses</strong></u><br/><br/>In addition to being a source of food, <em>T. tridentatus </em>is used for decoration, for sale to tourists or for other uses such as talisman, spiritual or medicinal properties and dead horseshoe crabs are frequently found decorating local homes in the Philippines (Schoppe 2001), including as wall decorations to protect children from vampires (Kaiser 2002, p. 113). In certain areas of Sabah, Malaysia, locals hang <em>T. tridentatus</em> in their homes for protection from bad spirits (Manca <em>et al</em>. 2017), and when a new plantation is opened a horseshoe crab, which represents fertility, may be sacrificed to ensure a good harvest (Laurie/Mohamad 2017, pers. comm). <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> is also sold for use in traditional healing remedies in Indonesia (Meilana <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/>In Philippines, adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> are sold in the Puerto Princesa city market both as live animals and as decorative items (Schoppe 2001). There is also an international trade in dried <em>T. tridentatus </em>carapaces from Palawan, which are sold on eBay and other online trading platforms via seashell and marine curio suppliers, although the extent of this trade has not been quantified (Laurie 2009-2014, pers. obs).<br/><br/><u><strong>Illegal Trade</strong></u><br/><br/>Sabah, Malaysia has strict regulations relating to the collection, study and export of biodiversity effectively meaning no one can access or export biodiversity without licences issued by the Sabah Biodiversity Council (SaBC 2017). However, commencing in 2017, Thai tourists visiting Inderesabah started buying gravid female T. tridentatus, extracting their eggs, then taking them back to Thailand in almost certain violation of these regulations (Laurie/Mohamad 2018, pers. comm).<br/>In Indonesia, horseshoe crabs were protected in Indonesia by Law No. 5 of 1990 of the Republic of Indonesia on the Conservation of Living Resources and their Ecosystems, under which it is illegal to take, keep, transport or trade in a protected species, including exporting or transporting internally within Indonesia (Indonesia Law No. 5/1990). This law only applied to <em>T. gigas</em>, but because of look-alike and interpretation issues, it was applied to all three horseshoe crab species in Indonesia (Laurie/Meilana 2015, pers. comm., Laurie/Wardiatno 2017a, pers. comm.). Despite this, and despite the best efforts of Indonesia law enforcement agencies, there is a substantial illegal trade in horseshoe crabs, which are usually smuggled via ports on the northeast coast of Sumatra to Malaysia, for onward transmission to Thailand. Whilst the principal focus of this trade is gravid <em>T. gigas</em> for consumption in Thailand, seizures of <em>T. tridentatus</em> are also made (Laurie/Meilana 2015, pers. comm.; Laurie/John 2017, pers. comm). Traders are also visiting remote fishing villages in Indonesia to recruit fishermen to capture horseshoe crabs for the international trade (Laurie/Meilana 2015, pers. comm). As an example, on 23 May 2012, five <em>T. tridentatus</em> were seized at Sam Ratulangi International Airport, Manado, North Sulawesi under PP No. 7/1999 (Indonesia Government Regulation No. 7/1999) and although described as T, gigas, photographs indicated the seized animals were <em>T. tridentatus</em> (BKIPM 2012).<br/><br/>In June 2018, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry upgraded PP No. 7/1999 (Indonesia Government Regulation No. 7/1999) and issued new regulations which made all three horseshoe crab species, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> protected species in Indonesia (Indonesia Government Regulation 20/2018).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Direct Species Protection</strong><em><br/><br/>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> is designated “Grade II Protected Animal of China” in the “List of State Key Protected Wildlife” and “Key Protected Aquatic Wildlife” in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, there is no effective management to protect the species due to a lack of scientific knowledge on its population status (Xie and Weng 2011). Despite the fact <em>T. tridentatus</em> is listed as a Key Protected Aquatic Wildlife in Guangxi, in a survey in September 2015 of coastal communities along Beibu Gulf in Guangxi, interviews revealed most people in the region, regardless of their age, consumed horseshoe crabs (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, horseshoe crabs were protected in Indonesia by Law No. 5 of 1990 of the Republic of Indonesia on the Conservation of Living Resources and their Ecosystems, under which it is illegal to take, keep, transport or trade in a protected species (Article 21.1. a), including exporting or transporting internally within Indonesia (Article 21.1. b) (Indonesia Law No. 5/1990), supplemented by Government Regulation No 7/1999 on Preserving Flora and Fauna Species (Indonesia Government Regulation No. 7/1999). Horseshoe crabs were also protected under Forestry Ministerial Decree No. 12/Kpts-II/1987 (Meilana and Fang 2017), which prohibits their exploitation or trade. Law No. 5 of 1990 Appendix II only identifies <em>T. gigas </em>as protected aquatic biota, although it appears to be applied on a look-alike basis to <em>T. tridentatus </em>using the Indonesian generic term for horseshoe crab ‘Ketam Tapak Kuda’ (Laurie/Wardianto 2017a, pers. comm.). In June 2018, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry upgraded Government Regulation No. 7/1999 <span lang=""EN"">and issued new regulations to protect all three horseshoe crab species, including <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Indonesia (Indonesia Government Regulation 20/2018).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Indirect Species Protection</strong><br/><br/>Malaysia is keen to prevent bio-piracy, where biological resources are accessed and extracted without permission and developed for commercialization, so that bio-prospecting initiatives must be carried out with Prior Informed Consent (Malaysia NBSAP 5 2014). In particular, both Sarawak and Sabah have very strict regulations relating to the collection, study and export of biodiversity and each state has established a Biodiversity Council to oversee such approvals. In Sarawak no person shall collect or export biological resources for research and development or for propagation to support such research and development without permits issued by the Sarawak Biodiversity Council (SBA 2016), whilst in Sabah, no researcher or institution can access or export biodiversity without licences issued by the Sabah Biodiversity Council (SaBC 2017). In both states, these regulations are strictly enforced and apply to horseshoe crabs, and because of this, <em>T. tridentatus</em> is not seriously exploited for foreign export (Laurie/John 2017, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Similarly, in Brunei Darussalam, a permit from the Fisheries Department is required for the export of all water organisms, including horseshoe crabs (BDNSW. 2014).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Habitat Protection</strong><br/><br/>In Japan in 1928, Oe-Hama Beach, Kasaoka was designated as a ‘Horseshoe Crab Spawning Ground National Monument’, but the inadequacies of this designation was demonstrated when this area was drained during the Kasaoka Bay Land Reclamation Project, a large scale land reclamation which commenced in 1969 (Sekiguchi 1988, p. 40, Tsuchiya 2009, p. 559). Areas of spawning site at Toyo region, Ehime Prefecture and Imari City are also protected as a natural monument by each local government, respectively (Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In China, there are two broad categories of Marine Protected Areas in China, No-take Marine Nature Reserves (No-take MNRs) and Multiple-use Marine Special Protected Areas (MSPA), but as a result of great user pressure and lack of enforcement capacity, the zoning schemes are often poorly recognized and implemented, so that even fully protected MNRs are implemented as multiple-use areas, so that certain levels of fishing and industrial activities are usually tolerated within them (Qiu <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Fujian, a 700 km² Ocean Special Protection Area, the Xiamen National Nature Reserve for Rare Marine Species, was designated in 2000 to protect a variety of coastal biodiversity including horseshoe crabs, with the objectives of preventing, minimizing and controlling negative human influences on horseshoe crab resources (Qiu <em>et al</em>. 2009; Hong 2011, p. 196). However, in the early 2000’s, an extensive sandy-mud beach planned for a local horseshoe crab reserve in Pingtan, Fujian was taken over by a businessman for a clam hatchery. Although this business failed, the reserve is gone, demonstrating the often difficult conflict that arises between conservation and economic development in China (Huang 2011), whilst in Guangdong, seven city, county or province level horseshoe crab nature reserves have been established since 2001 (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In Taiwan,<em> T. tridentatus</em> is protected on Matsu Island, part of an offshore archipelago in the northern end of the Taiwan Strait (Hsieh and Chen 2015) and the Kinmen Kuningtou Northwest Intertidal Terrain Horseshoe Crab Conservation Area was designated as a no-take zone in 1999 under the Fisheries Law of Taiwan (Taiwan Fisheries Agency 2016). However, there are no penalties for violations within the designated area for activities such as habitat destruction or pollution (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, there are no designated areas for <em>T. tridentatus</em> conservation, but three spawning and nursery grounds, Tsim Bei Tsui, Pak Nai and San Tau and Lai Chi Wo, are listed as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) to protect other species, in a land-use planning system in which new development is not permitted in most circumstances because of their ecological significance (Lai 1998, Chiu and Morton 2003).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, Kota Kinabalu Wetland in Sabah was accorded Bird Sanctuary status in 1996 and declared a State Cultural Heritage Site in 1998 (Robert et al. 2014), whilst in Indonesia, there is no conservation area dedicated to the protection of horseshoe crabs (Meilana and Fang 2017).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Temporal Conservation Measures</strong><br/><br/>Apart from special measures, China has also tried to introduce temporal measures to protect <em>T. tridentatus</em>. In 2000, the Pingtan government in Fujian issued orders to protect horseshoe crabs, including restricting any unit from catching, selling or dealing in horseshoe crabs and horseshoe crab related products, and anyone was restricted from catching horseshoe crabs between 1 May and 31 August (Hong 2011, p. 197). In 2000, fishermen in Lianzhou Bay, Beihai, Guangxi were asked to remove their nets and fish cages, which were blocking the passage of spawning horseshoe crabs, to open up passageways between the shore and the sea, to allow horseshoe crabs to reach their spawning grounds, then return to the sea (People’s Daily 2000).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Indirect Habitat Protection from Trawling</strong><br/><br/>In Hong Kong, adult <em>T. tridentatus</em> were vulnerable to bottom trawling, but since this was banned in December 2012, this threat to adult horseshoe crabs no longer exists, which could result in a stabilization of adult populations (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Inshore bottom trawling is also banned in Indonesia (CITES 2000) and in Taiwan, bottom trawling was once one of the most important coastal fisheries, but annual production started to decline due to overfishing and because of bycatch problems in the 1980s, inshore bottom trawling was banned from within three nautical miles of the shoreline in 1989 (CITES 2000, Shao <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Habitat-Based Conservation Actions</strong><br/><br/>The Japanese Society for the Preservation of the Horseshoe crab (Kabutogani wo Mamoru kai) was established at 1978 for conservation of <em>T. tridentatus</em>, and has branch offices at some habitats/prefectures. Some local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and groups, including the above society, are conducting conservation activities such as field surveys, beach clean-ups, social education and other activities. Release programs/events of juveniles and/or sub-adults which are reared from eggs are carried out at some habitats for recovery of population by local government/NGO/group, although there is an ongoing discussion about its effectiveness.<br/><br/>Imari Bay on northern Kyushu was considered by Sekiguchi (1988) to have the largest population of <em>T. tridentatus</em> in Japan, but the abundance of horseshoe crabs is limited by the scarcity of suitable spawning habitat. One of the few breeding areas is Tatara Beach, which is a mere 16 m by 28 m patch located where a breakwater meets a seawall (Sekiguchi 1988, Fig. IV-10, p. 62). This site requires periodic replenishment to maintain the sand (Botton 2001, p. 45), meaning that the horseshoe crab populations are conservation-reliant (dependent on human support for survival) at this location. Similar habitat-based conservation measures have been taken to combat the effects caused by the wake of passing ships on horseshoe crab spawning grounds along the Konoshima Channel, Kasaoka City, where a series of groins were built and beach nourishment programs were initiated to minimize the impact of land alteration in the area (Seino <em>et al</em>. 2003, p. 6, Table 2).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Restocking</strong><br/><br/>In the past, thousands of Instars I and II have been released into the wild on Kinmen, Taiwan and in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Guangdong, China, but the efficacy of such release programs has not been evaluated and juvenile survival rates after release are not known (Hsieh and Chen 2015). Between 2005 and 2009, more than 40,000 juvenile <em>T. tridentatus</em> were released in the vicinity of Xiamen as part of a biological resources and rare species protection and recovery program (Oceanweek.Org 2009) and in 2010 the Guangdong Provincial Government jointly held a mass release at Yangjiang City of juvenile marine animals of economic, rare and endangered species, including juvenile horseshoe crabs (Farmers Daily 2010). Although scientifically supervised juvenile release programs have also been undertaken in Taiwan (Hsieh and Chen 2015) and Hong Kong (Shin <em>et al</em>. 2011), their efficacy is still being assessed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Law Enforcement</strong><br/><br/>Horseshoe crabs, including <em>T. tridentatus</em>, are protected in China and Indonesia. Despite the significant size of both countries, periodic seizures involving <em>T. tridentatus</em> are reported, in both China (Weng <em>et al</em>. 2013, SCMP 2017) and Indonesia (BKIPM 2012), although the effectiveness of enforcement effort has not been evaluated.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Harvest Management</strong><br/><br/>The absence of harvest regulations is considered the main cause of the decline in <em>T. tridentatus </em>population numbers throughout much of its central range (Gauvry 2015), specifically in China (China Species Red List 2009b).</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
178341498,178290276,Pycnopodia helianthoides,Critically Endangered,A2ace,2020,2020-08-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> has experienced dramatic decreases in population size and range after enduring a global disease outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS). From 2013-2017, <em>Pycnopodia </em>and other sea star species were devastated by SSWS, which affected a variety of sea star species across more than 5,000 km of the western coast of North America (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2019; Menge <em>et al. </em>2016; Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016; Miner <em>et al.</em> 2018; Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2019; Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019). Prior to 2013, <em>Pycnopodia </em>was regularly found in a variety of shallow marine habitats from the Pacific Coast of Baja California, Mexico to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States. It is a non-harvested, generalist species and had few major threats prior to the disease outbreak.&#160;<br/><br/>After the rapid loss of <em>Pycnopodia </em>to SSWS from 2013-2017, we compiled 31 datasets including 61,043 surveys that showed that <em>Pycnopodia </em>population size declined by 90.6% from its historic to its current population size. Additionally, the area of occupancy has declined 57.6% from 4,052 km² before the outbreak (2003-2012) to 1,716 km² afterward. The species is now extremely rare across much of the outer coast of the contiguous United States and Mexico, a swath of 2500 km of coastline. Since the initial outbreak subsided around 2016-17, <em>Pycnopodia</em> populations have not begun to recover, are still declining in many regions, and have reached near-zero densities along the outer coasts of the contiguous United States and Mexico. Further, there is evidence that the disease is still present in remaining populations, and warming water from global climate change seems to contribute to disease severity.&#160;<br/><br/>The decline of this predatory sea star species may have ecosystem-wide implications. Evidence in some locales suggests that the loss of predatory <em>Pycnopodia </em>on rocky reefs can substantially reduce their predation on sea urchins, allowing urchins populations to grow and overgraze kelp. Kelp are the foundational species in kelp forest ecosystems and provide habitat and food to many organisms, including those in important fisheries (e.g. abalone, rockfish). However, it is not yet known whether the role of <em>Pycnopodia </em>as a sea urchin predator is a key driver of kelp forest health in North America or whether their role is important only under certain circumstances. In places where <em>Pycnopodia </em>does benefit kelp, the recovery of <em>Pycnopodia </em>may be a valuable management tool for maintaining healthy kelp forest ecosystems in the future.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Pycnopodia </em>meets the qualification for Critically Endangered under Criterion A2ace on the basis of its 90.6% global decline. Additionally, it qualifies for Vulnerable under Criterion B2ab as its current area of occupancy is less than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, its number of locations could be as low as 1, and there is evidence for continuing population declines. <em>Pycnopodia</em> qualifies as Least Concern under Criteria C and D, and Data Deficient under Criterion E. For further details see the Supplementary Materials.","<strong>Habitats<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>appears to be a habitat generalist, occurring on many different types of marine habitats including mud, sand, shell, gravel, rocky bottoms, kelp forests, and the lower rocky intertidal (Fisher 1928, Mauzey <em>et al.</em> 1968, Lambert 2000). Previous work on <em>Pycnopodia </em>has shown variable associations with one or another habitat types depending on life stage and region (Shivji <em>et al.</em> 1983). Our analysis of habitat preferences showed that no clear associations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>with particular habitat or substrate types in California (see Supplementary Material: Data Analysis: Depth and Habitat Patterns for more information). Because of this finding, we did not incorporate habitat type into our population estimates.&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Depths<br/></strong>Previous sources have identified the depth range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>to be from 0 - 435 m (0 - 1427 ft) and typically no more than 120 m (394 ft) (Fisher 1928, Lambert 2000, Hemery <em>et al. </em>2016). In our global analysis, we found that <em>Pycnopodia </em>was most abundant before the sea star wasting syndrome outbreak in shallow nearshore waters less than 25 m (82 ft), less abundant in middle depths 25 m to 50 m (164 ft), and present but rare to depths up to 300 m (Mean ± SD: 39,077 ± 226,556 km<sup>-2</sup>, 1,996 ± 5,573 km<sup>-2</sup>, and 204 ± 740 km<sup>-2</sup>, respectively). The large standard deviations in these averages are because <em>Pycnopodia </em>tends to be patchily distributed. <em>Pycnopodia </em>was very rare below 300 m depth, with only 12 records. The deepest record was 455 m (1493 ft), though it is possible that this and other deep records were actually misidentified <em>Rathbunaster californicus</em>, a species that looks similar and extends deeper. The upper depth range extends into the low intertidal zone to around 0 m above mean lower low water, especially along the Alaskan coast (Konar<em> et al.</em> 2019). Regarding depth preferences in shallower waters within the range of SCUBA (&lt;30 m or &lt;100 ft), no pattern in densities (Bonaviri<em> et al.</em> 2017) nor sizes (Shivji <em>et al. </em>1983) with depth have been noted in the literature. We also detected no pattern in densities within this shallower range (up to 25 m).<br/><strong><br/>Environmental Range<br/></strong>The large geographic range of this species indicates it can inhabit a wide variety of environments. Along the Oregon coast, correlations between <em>Pycnopodia </em>distributions and environmental conditions suggest that their abundances are driven most strongly by annual mean daily water temperature (peak at 9-11.5 °C), depth (peak at 0 to 75m) and annual mean daily salinity (peak at 33.0-33.4 PSU), in that order (Hemery<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160; Within the 12-16°C gradient in mean annual water temperature along the Channel Islands, California, <em>Pycnopodia </em>was more abundant at the cooler western islands (San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands) than the warmer eastern islands (Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands), and 14°C seemed to be strong cutoff driving abundance (Bonaviri <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet and Ecological Role<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>is a generalist and opportunistic predator that consumes a large number of prey taxa including but not limited to gastropods, echinoderms, and crustaceans (Supp. Fig. 6; Mauzey<em> et al. </em>1968, Herrlinger 1983, Beas-Luna <em>et al. </em>2014). <em>Pycnopodia </em>is usually considered a macroinvertivore since the bulk of its prey fit this category. Preferred prey items vary due to local abundance, climate, latitude, and habitat gradients. For example, Mytilus trossulus (formerly M. edulis) has been reported to be a favorite prey item in the Gulf of Alaska (Paul and Feder 1975), gastropods in British Columbia (Shivji<em> et al.</em> 1983), sea urchins in northern California (Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019) and gastropods and crustaceans in central California (Herrlinger 1983). Interestingly, very few species feed on <em>Pycnopodia </em>(Supp. Fig. 6; Mauzey <em>et al.</em> 1968).<br/><br/>As a generalist predator, <em>Pycnopodia </em>can regulate the structure of nearshore benthic communities and are considered a keystone predator in some areas across its distribution (Duggins 1983, Herrlinger 1983). <em>Pycnopodia </em>preys on sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. droebachiensis, and Mesocentrotus franciscanus) and can create small, urchin-free zones through direct predation or by causing sea urchin “stampedes” (Paine and Vadas 1969, Duggins 1983, Watson and Estes 2011). Since sea urchins feed on kelp (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera, and Nereocystis luetkeana) the short-term existence of prey-free patches can influence algal diversity, community primary productivity, and kelp forest community structure (Paine and Vadas 1969, Dayton 1975, Duggins 1983, Herrlinger 1983). Since the SSWS outbreak began in 2013, several papers have identified further evidence of the potential ecological role <em>Pycnopodia </em>can play in kelp forest ecosystems. The loss of this predator was associated with a 311% increase in the abundance of medium-sized urchins and a 30% decline in kelp densities in British Columbia, suggesting <em>Pycnopodia </em>exerts top-down control over urchin populations (Burt <em>et al. </em>2018). A similar phenomenon has been observed in southern British Columbia, Northern California, and southern California (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre<em> et al.</em> 2020). The potential for <em>Pycnopodia </em>to play a role in regulating kelp forest community structure and dynamics may be strongest in regions lacking other sea urchin predators, such as otters.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Life History and Reproduction<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>has separate sexes and broadcast spawn to produce free-swimming, feeding, pelagic larvae (Greer 1962, Morris<em> et al.</em> 1980). The larvae develop for 50-146 days before settling and metamorphosing (Strathmann 1978, J. Hodin pers. comm. 2020). Beyond this basic information, little is understood about the reproductive ecology, growth rates, physiology, and longevity of <em>Pycnopodia</em>. They exhibit indeterminate growth and have not been individually tagged successfully nor reared in captivity from birth through adulthood, so determining lifespan and growth rates is challenging. We interviewed aquarists and larval ecologists, gathered size distribution data and used models to estimate the generation time for <em>Pycnopodia</em>. We found generation time to be in the range of 20.5 – 65 years, with the middle-most estimates providing a narrower range of 27 – 37 years range (Supp. Figs. 7 and 8 and Supp. Table 6). For more information on reproduction, life history, and generation time modeling, see Supplementary Materials: Habitats and Ecology: Life History and Ecology &amp; Determination of Generation Time.","<strong>Disease<br/></strong>Without question, disease is currently the greatest threat to <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations. This global analysis and many published works (Hewson<em> et al. </em>2014, Montecino-Latorre <em>et al. </em>2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Burt <em>et al.</em> 2018, Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2019, Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020) demonstrate that this species’ precipitous decline corresponds to the outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome in 2013-2017. Though the global outbreak appears to have subsided, localized outbreaks continue to occur in <em>Pycnopodia </em>and other sea star species. The pathogen or agent that causes SSWS remains unknown (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019). While disease is the proximate threat, there is also evidence that climate change in the form of increasing temperatures exacerbates or may have triggered the disease (see Climate Change below). It is imperative that we understand disease etiology and dynamics in coordination with any attempts to mitigate disease effects or aid <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery. For more information see Supplementary Material: Threats.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Climate Change&#160;<br/></strong>There is evidence that warmer temperatures speed the progression and increase mortality from SSWS in the laboratory (Eisenlord <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kohl <em>et al.</em> 2016). Anomalously warm water temperature has been associated with region-specific timing of SSWS outbreaks in <em>Pycnopodia </em>(Eisenlord <em>et al.</em> 2016, Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019, Aalto <em>et al.</em> 2020). Understanding the mechanistic relationship between temperature and SSWS will help to understand the continued risks for <em>Pycnopodia </em>and inform recovery efforts. For more on the interaction of climate change and SSWS threats, please see the Supplementary Material: Threats.&#160;<br/><br/>It also is likely that warming waters with global climate change may directly decrease <em>Pycnopodia </em>densities. Along the Oregon coast, Hemery <em>et al.</em> (2016) found strong effects of temperature, with peak abundances occurring at 9–11.5°C. Similarly, in Southern California warmer water temperature was associated with decreasing density of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, and 14°C seemed to be a strong cutoff driving abundance (Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overall, it is possible that ocean warming from human-caused climate change could drive decreases in <em>Pycnopodia </em>density in surviving populations or prohibit recovery.<br/><br/><strong>Fishing and Trade<br/></strong>While bycatch of <em>Pycnopodia </em>occurs in multiple fisheries (i.e. trap, seine, and trawl), more information is needed to determine whether this is a threat to <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations. Similarly, we do not know whether dried <em>Pycnopodia </em>traded by online retailers represents a threat. Finally, there are anecdotal observations that refuge populations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in the fjords of British Columbia may be disrupted by the practice of “log dumping”, where timber is felled into the fjords before transport (T. Blaine, pers. comm.). The threat this poses to these refuge populations is unknown. When population sizes of <em>Pycnopodia</em> are large, it is unlikely that any of these external sources of mortality from fishing and trade pose a substantial threat to the species. However, these activities could hinder population recovery in areas with severely reduced population sizes. Further investigation of these potential threats is needed.","<strong>Historical Abundance<br/></strong>Literature on <em>Pycnopodia</em> abundance before the 2013–2017 sea star wasting disease outbreak suggests that they were fairly common throughout their range. These include studies from Alaska, United States (Duggins 1983, Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019), British Columbia, Canada (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Burt<em> et al.</em> 2018), Oregon, United States (Hemery <em>et al.</em> 2016), and California, United States (Herrlinger 1983, Eckert 2007, Rassweiler <em>et al. </em>2010, Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020). The most geographically comprehensive study was done by Harvell <em>et al. </em>(2019) from Alaska to California. For details on each of these studies, please see the Supplementary Material: <em>Pycnopodia </em>Populations in the Literature.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>The Outbreak of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome<br/></strong>Many of the studies referenced above detail the recent declines in <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations caused by the outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) that began in 2013 (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017, Burt <em>et al.</em> 2018, Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019, Konar <em>et al. </em>2019, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020). Harvell <em>et al. </em>(2019) showed a 100% decline in Oregon and California and a 99.2% decline in Washington due to SSWS. SSWS is the largest marine epizootic on record (Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019) and affected over 20 species of sea stars (Hewson <em>et al. </em>2014). <em>Pycnopodia </em>was especially vulnerable (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al. </em>2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016) because it was the most susceptible of the sea star taxa affected by the multi-host SSWS pathogen (Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019). SSWS was first observed in the Olympic Coast of Washington in June 2013 followed by Central California and the Salish Sea in summer 2013. It quickly expanded south to Mexico and slowly northward, arriving in the Aleutian Islands by 2016. While the cause of SSWS is unclear (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2018), it causes lesions, arm loss, and ultimately death within days to weeks, and very few individuals recover once symptoms appear (Hewson <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/><strong>Estimating Population Sizes over Time<br/></strong>We assessed the global population of <em>Pycnopodia</em> using 31 datasets (Supp. Fig.1 and Supp. Table 1) from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska to the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. These included 61,043 surveys spanning from 1967 to 2020 and distributed from the rocky intertidal to the bathyal plain at 984m deep. Since the <em>Pycnopodia </em>decline followed an abrupt non-linear pattern (Supp. Fig. 2), we elected to compare the population decline before versus after sea star wasting syndrome (see Supplementary Material for more detail on this timeline). To estimate global population trends (Supp. Fig. 3), we first the estimated seafloor surface area among regions and depths to quantify available habitat (Supp. Tables 2 and 3). We then determined how densities (1987-2019) of <em>Pycnopodia </em>varied by region, depth, and outbreak phase (Supp. Fig. 4 and Supp.&#160; Tables 2 and 5). We then multiplied density by habitat area to calculate the estimated population size before and after the SSWS outbreak (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). For further details on these methods, please refer to Supplementary Material: Population Data and Methods for IUCN Assessment.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Global Decline<br/></strong>Our global analysis confirms the declines caused by sea star wasting syndrome documented in many of the studies above. Indeed, many of the datasets in the references above were included in our global analyses. We calculated a 90.6% global decline in <em>Pycnopodia </em>population size when comparing before (1987-2013) to after (2014, 2015 or 2017-2019, depending on the region) the SSWS outbreak (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). The decline extended to all depths, with a 92.9% decline in deep depths (&gt;25m) and a 93.8% decline in shallow depths (&lt;25m) (Supp. Table 2). The global post-decline population estimate is 594,251,528 (average between 2014/2015/2017 and 2019, depending on timing of the decline in each region). However, the global estimate for 2019 is 80,627,721.<br/><br/><strong>Region-Specific Declines&#160;<br/></strong>Among regions in shallow waters (where the vast majority of animals are found), the most severe declines occurred in the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the outer coast of the western continental United States, where the decline ranged from 97.2% - 99.8% (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). Severe declines also occurred in many northern regions, including a 91.9% decline in the Salish Sea, a 94.7% decline in southeast Alaska, and a 94.9% decline in the eastern Gulf of Alaska.<br/><br/>The western Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands showed more moderate population declines (61.1% decline, Supp. Table 2), and observations by contributors suggest the disease was less severe in these regions (B. Konar, pers. comm. 2020). However, sparse observations make these estimates uncertain (Supp. Table 2; N = 7 surveys after the SSWS-induced decline). We present two estimates of decline for the north, central and coastal British Columbian coast. The first compares before and after the Aug 1 2015 pre-/post-crash cutoff (matches analysis use for other regions) and indicates a moderate decline (67.4%). However, we believe this number is an underestimate because it incorporates the data from juvenile animals that recruited to Calvert Island, British Columbia shortly after SSWS. This population then experienced a second decline in 2018, presumably due to another SSWS outbreak, and most did not reach adult size (A. Gehman pers. obs. 2020). We were not able to separate these juveniles from adults, so we narrowed our post-decline population estimate using data from 2018-2019 only, when the second outbreak had subsided and the remaining animals were generally nearing adult size. Using this method, we estimated that the decline in this region was 89.9% (Supp. Table 2).<br/><br/><strong>Continued Declines<br/></strong>The remaining populations are primarily in the northern half of the species’ previous range and are patchily-distributed populations in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska, north, central and coastal British Columbia, and the Salish Sea (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). Very few animals remain along the outer coast of the United States and Mexico (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2).&#160;Importantly, there is little indication that <em>Pycnopodia </em>is in the process of recovering from the outbreak (Supp. Fig. 5 and Supp. Table 4). Indeed, most regions with remaining populations, including much of Alaska and British Columbia (including the Salish Sea), have exhibited continuing declines since 2017. Regions on the outer coast of the contiguous United States and Mexico, have “flat lined” at extremely low densities (Supp. Fig. 5; Washington outer coast, Oregon, North, Central, Southern and Baja California). <em>Pycnopodia </em>is now very rare along this &gt; 2500 km stretch of coastline, and seem to be decreasing. Notably, in all of the United States and Mexican contiguous outer coast, only 20 of 3976 total surveys recorded an animal between 2018-2019, with only 7 in California, and most of these were lone individuals. No animals have been recorded in Baja California since 2015, and none in California in 2019 (Supp. Table 4).",Decreasing,"<strong>Range Description<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> is commonly found in marine waters ranging from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States to San Diego, California, United States (Herrlinger 1983). However, this global analysis shows that the historical southern limit of <em>Pycnopodia </em>extends to Isla Natividad, Baja California, Mexico (27.84501°N, 115.1428°W). From there, it used to be common northward throughout the Pacific coastline of North America. Our northernmost observation is in Bettles Bay near Anchorage Alaska, United States (60.95496°N, 148.29942°W). From our data, it also extends westward along the Aleutian Island chain to the Fox Islands near Nikolski, Alaska (52.63844°N, 169.1337°W), and researchers have observed it as far west as Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, in the Andreanof Islands in 2006 (S. Jewett pers. comm. 2020). Other than a single, and perhaps misidentified, observation near St. George Island, Alaska (56.67678°N, 169.5519°W), the species does not appear to extend into the Bering Sea.<br/><br/><strong>Depth Range<br/></strong>Our analysis and historical records show that the depth range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>is from 0 to 455 m (0–1,493 ft) with the highest abundance between 0 and 25 m deep. They are rare deeper than 120 m (394 ft) (Fisher 1928, Lambert 2000, Hemery <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Number of Locations<br/></strong>The primary threat to <em>Pycnopodia</em> is sea star wasting syndrome, which appears to have caused declines in all populations globally within three years. Thus, the minimum number of locations (defined by IUCN as a geographically or ecologically distinct area in which a single threatening process can rapidly affect all occurrences of an ecosystem type) could be as low as 1. However, considering the species’ broad geographic range and the finding that populations in the northwestern edge of its range may have been less affected by the disease, the number of locations may be as high as 10.","No targeted fisheries exist for <em>Pycnopodia</em>. Although most regions allow recreational harvest of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, the harvest rate is likely extremely low. However, <em>Pycnopodia </em>is routinely encountered as bycatch in bottom-contacted pot and trap fisheries as well as trawl and seine fisheries (Supp. Figs. 9 and 10). The encounter rate and survival rate as bycatch is unclear. They are difficult to disentangle without injury, so handling may decrease survival. There is no evidence that this species is widely traded as a live animal in the aquarium trade. Their large size and predatory behavior probably deter nearly all aquarists. Although not pervasive, dried “sunflower sea stars” are commercially sold individually online as decor. For details, see the Supplementary Material: Use and Trade.",Marine,"<strong>Determining the Cause of SSWS<br/></strong>The cause of SSWS is an essential question that should be answered before we can determine the advisability of <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery efforts. The persistence of SSWS, especially in other species, may potentially negate or greatly reduce the efficacy of any <em>Pycnopodia </em>captive rearing and reintroduction efforts outlined below. Further, we have no diagnostic test for SSWS to ensure that sea stars that we may introduce to the wild are not a danger to wild <em>Pycnopodia </em>or to other sea stars.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Captive Rearing and Reintroduction<br/></strong>Captive rearing is the most viable recovery option for locales with few or no <em>Pycnopodia </em>that are far from surviving populations (i.e. the outer Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico). While this conservation action does not address the underlying threats to <em>Pycnopodia </em>(disease and climate change), it can be used to restore populations in suitable areas that may not otherwise recover on their own. Drawing from aquaculture practices, captive rearing of <em>Pycnopodia </em>has the potential for cost-effective high production on a relatively quick timescale. Captive rearing efforts could provide a reservoir of individuals to maintain genetic diversity, maintain population numbers, and aid in the recovery of the species. Further, captive rearing programs can have the simultaneous benefit of being scientific resources to study SSWS and to gather information on the life history and environmental niche of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, which could aid subsequent recovery efforts. To this end, the Nature Conservancy and the University of Washington have collaborated to begin the captive rearing of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, have demonstrated its feasibility, and have accumulated valuable life history information (e.g., growth rates, environmental conditions, diets) that will inform future conservation actions.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reducing Lethal Take<br/></strong>While we assume direct harvest is relatively low (see Use and Trade), even a small amount of take in this critically endangered species can hinder recovery. Currently, there are few protections against harvest of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in most regions and we have little information on harvest statistics. Enacting specific regulations that disallow the targeted harvest of <em>Pycnopodia </em>could reduce this source of mortality, which could be particularly important for small, remnant populations.<br/><br/>Reducing bycatch, particularly in trap fisheries, is an additional potential conservation action to aid recovery of <em>Pycnopodia</em>. Since the threat posed by bycatch to <em>Pycnopodia </em>is unclear (see Use and Trade and Threats), the first conservation action should be to determine its magnitude. If bycatch indeed can cause decline or hinder recovery (particularly in vulnerable populations), public engagement with the recreational and commercial fleets about best practices for catch and release would be a logical next step.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Localized Protections<br/></strong>The recovery of isolated or sparse populations of adult <em>Pycnopodia </em>or the success of new recruitment events may also benefit from locally focused protection from take or disturbance. For example, one of the few surviving populations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in the contiguous United States occurs in Hood Canal, Washington, where bycatch from the local crab fishery could have a negative impact on persistence or recovery. Similarly, there are surviving populations in the fjords of Central British Columbia (T. Blaine pers. comm. 2020) where the practice of&#160; “log dumping” (felling or storing trees in the marine environment for later transport), could have detrimental effects on those populations. Some localized, and perhaps temporary, protections against human activity for these survivors may aid local recovery. Further, there is modest evidence that juvenile <em>Pycnopodia </em>utilize nearshore seagrass beds as a nursery habitat (A. Gehman and M. Miner pers. obs. 2020). Seagrass beds are highly susceptible to habitat degradation (Orth <em>et al.</em> 2006) so protecting these habitats may aid <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery. Finally, the recovery of this species in severely affected areas is contingent on recruitment from remote source populations. Since recruitment of <em>Pycnopodia </em>is often episodic and mortality of juveniles quite high (Sewell and Watson 1993), the success of a recruitment event may hinge on the local rates of mortality from human activities like fishing and habitat destruction.&#160;<br/><br/>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) may also serve as a viable, but less targeted, conservation action. While the spatially explicit protection afforded by MPAs does not necessarily protect <em>Pycnopodia </em>from its two most important threats, SSWS and climate change, MPAs can mitigate harvest, pollution, and habitat degradation. Multiple MPAs already exist in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and comprise ~1.55% of the range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>(5,377,374 km<sup>2</sup>; see Supplemental Material: Conservation Actions for details on these MPAs). These MPAs could also serve as target areas for the restoration and re-establishment of <em>Pycnopodia </em>by affording space-based protections during recovery. (see Supplemental Material: Conservation Actions and https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UM662HazRfvtnCrXdUJAszUn6jv0Ok-Yj5XiHETU30/edit?usp=sharing for details on these MPAs).","",,false,false,Global

Urgent research is needed to assess the population size and harvest level.,"This species has been found on soft sediments only (O'Shea 1999). Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that all members of the Opisthoteuthidae are primarily benthic.&#160;Cirrate octopods have several characteristics likely to make them rather slow to recover from population declines: longevity, slow growth and low fecundity. Embryonic development time has been estimated to range between 1.4 years and 2.6 years in three cirrate species based on models that incorporate egg size and water temperature, the shorter time being for a relatively shallow water species in warmer waters (Collins and Villanueva 2006). Studies of reproduction suggest a prolonged spawning period (with growth continuing during spawning) and eggs released one or two at a time (assumed because there are only ever one or two eggs in the distal oviduct). Eggs are thought to be laid singly on the sea floor and not brooded. Estimates of mean fecundity have been around 1,500 oocytes suggesting spawning may extend over multiple years, once reproductive maturity is reached. Difficulties of ageing cirrate octopods mean that no estimates for life span or generation length have been published, although Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that given the above factors, and the low metabolic rates of cephalopods in cold deep waters, the life cycle takes many years.","Deep-water fisheries are a major threat to this species. It used to occur in bycatch of the orange roughy fishery but has not been seen for more than 10 years (Freeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). The suspected long life cycle and slow maturation may make this species (and other opisthoteuthid species) particularly susceptible to fishing pressure. On the New Zealand National Red List, this species is listed as Nationally Critical (Freeman<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2010). The genus&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis</em>&#160;is the most shallow genus of cirrate octopods and is therefore the genus most affected directly by commercial deep-water trawling. Other cirrates inhabit generally greater depths, else their maximum depth is at least deeper and below the capacity of trawlers. In addition, unlike other cirrates, the behaviour and mode of life of the genus&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis</em>&#160;is characterized by a close association to the benthos (i.e., they are not pelagic or benthopelagic as other cirrates), making them more accessible and/or catchable by bottom trawling nets and therefore more vulnerable to deep-water trawling activities.","<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Freeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2010) estimate a greater than 70% decline in population size in recent years.

The species was previously common in fisheries bycatch and was only described in 2000. Data on the exact timeframe of the population decline were not available, but given the relative longevity of the species, and its recent description, it is likely that this has occurred over less than three generations, and probably in less than 10 years.
