1616879,180337,Actinopyga mauritiana,Vulnerable,A2bd,2013,2010-05-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>    </p><p>This species is commercially exploited throughout its range, and is a medium value species that is somewhat difficult to collect (as it can hide in crevices and is found on the reef crest). It is a common species that is becoming increasingly rare, but has relatively high fecundity. Based on a number of quantitative and qualitative studies, populations are estimated to be depleted and have declined by more than 60-90% in at least 60% of its range over the past 50 years, and is considered overexploited in at least 25% of it range although exact declines are difficult to estimate. The status of populations in East Africa are unknown, but it is known to be collected. Declines and over-exploitation have occurred primarily since the 1960s, and although generation length is not known, echinoderms are not considered to go through senescence and therefore may be greater than several decades. At present, global declines are therefore estimated to be between 30%-40% based on estimates of depletion and overexploitation across its range. This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable. </p>    <p>However, better and more quantitative data are needed to better estimate the impact of fishing on this species. If other shallow water species are continued to be fished out, effort for this species will probably increase even further. <br/></p>  <p></p>","<p>In the Western Central Pacific Region, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga mauritiana</span> prefers outer reef flats and  fringing reefs, mostly in the surf zone between 0-20 m. This species is characteristic  of the outer reef flats, as part of the medio-littoral reef community. Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2008) reports that it is more active during the day  when it feeds on the substrate. In the Africa and Indian Oceans, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana </span>prefers the outer reef flats with  surf influence over sand substrate between 0-5 m. It holds on to the  hard bottom when exposed to wave action (Conand 2008). In China, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana</span> lives in depths between  10 and 50m (Li 2004). In the Red Sea, it is usually found in subtidal and  intertidal sandy areas, as well as sea grass and sand lagoons in  the coral reef zone. Members of this species can be found over a wide range of depths, however the majority are found between 5 and 10 m (Gabr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). In  Solomon Islands, adults are commonly found around solid reef rock  and scattered tables of the coral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Acropora</span> sp. (Graham and Battaglene  2004).</p>This species has a high fecundity and early sexual maturity. However, many sea cucumbers are broadcast spawners, which can limit the fertilization success of a species in exploited populations.<p>In Egypt, females reach Size at Maturity (SOM) at 23 cm TL (Gabr et al. 2004). In general, in Guam&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;mauritiana</span> reaches SOM at 158 g (drained weight) (Hooper   1998), whilst in New     Caledonia it   reaches SOM at 350 g (Conand 1993). In the Africa and Indian Ocean region, this species reaches sexual maturity at 23 cm TL (Conand   2008).</p>  <p>In Guam, the peak reproductive  activity is between April and August, whilst in New Caledonia it is in December and January, and in the Solomon  Islands from October until January (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008).<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Actinopyga mauritiania</span>&#160;presents  annual cycles that relates to ambient ocean temperature and photoperiod  in Guam (Hopper <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1998). In Egypt it reproduces annually between spring and summer, and individuals  are mature at 23 cm TL (Gabr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2004, Conand 2008).</p><p>    </p>    <p>    </p><p>The generation length of this species is unknown. Its body size is not a good indicator of age or longevity. There is some indication, however, that many echinoderms do not go through senescence, but simply regenerate. Therefore generation length cannot be estimated, but is assumed to be greater than several decades in a natural, un-disturbed environment.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p><p></p>  <p></p>","<p>    </p><p>Although heavily targeted,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Actinopyga mauritiana</span> is difficult to fish because it is found on the exposed reef crest, and is somewhat cryptic (found in crevices). Although not one of the most important species (medium value) for  fishery purposes, it can be expected that this species may become more  popular after the depletion or reduction of other species of higher  commercial importance and value. This scenario was seen in Fiji, after  the decline of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga miliaris</span> as well as in Torres Strait (Australia) after the decline of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Holothuria scabra</span> (Kinch <em>et al.</em> 2008a).</p>  <p></p>    <p>Excessive commercial harvest of this species is reason for concern in some of its range. Choo (2008) states that&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga</span><em>&#160;mauritiana</em> is of commercial importance in China, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. In Seychelles, it is one of the most important commercial species, along with five others, where it is considered to be overexploited (Aumeeruddy and Conand 2008). Depletion of wild stock in Egypt has prompted the study and possible development of an aquaculture venture (Gabr <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/></p>","<p>This species used to be common in many areas of its range, but is increasingly rare. This species has been depleted in at least 60% of its range (e.g. South  Pacific, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea). This species is considered overexploited in  at least another 25% of its range (e.g India, Torres Strait) and the  fishery has been closed in these regions. The status of populations that  are fished in East Africa and the Red Sea are unknown and some  statistics are unreliable. Depletion refers to commercially un-viable,  and is estimated to represent an approximately 60 to 90% loss over the past 50 years (since the 1960s). In areas  where it is considered overexploited, the population is difficult to  estimate based on differences in regional and local fishing effort, but  harvests have declined and based on traditional fisheries definitions  overexploited is estimated to be 30% above maximum sustainable yield.</p><p><strong>Regional information:</strong></p><p>Several population surveys in the  Western Central Pacific Region showed this species to be moderately common (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), but later it was considered at low  abundance in the same area. Similar findings are reported for Fakaofo  and Atafu (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In the Cook Islands, most species of sea cucumbers were at low abundance, with the exception of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga mauritiana</span>  (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In the Solomon Islands, it was considered rare. In New Caledonia, populations of this species appear low and will need  to be managed prudently to safeguard stocks from dwindling to levels  where they cannot easily be repopulated naturally (Purcell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).</p>     <p>In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) a sea cucumber fishery started in 1995 mainly  because of the relative abundance of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;mauritiana</span> (and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Stichopus chloronotus</span>), and continued until 1996 when the fishery moved to Saipan due to a drop in  harvest because of overexploitation. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A.  mauritiana </span>made up ca. 99% of exports. Population surveys estimated that the population of this species<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>was between 10-22% of its initial population size. In the Federated States of  Micronesia (FSM), only <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. choloronotus</span> were believed to be  abundant enough to support a commercial fishery, with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana</span> being the principal commercial species. In Nauru, the species seems to be the only  commercially viable species. In Kiribati, it is part of a multispecies fishery that is considered overexploited after a short exploitation period  between 2000-2002. On Wallis, there is a small but growing sea cucumber multispecies fishery targeting <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A.  mauritiana</span>. In Samoa, the bêche-de-mer fishery consists of ca. 30% <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A.  mauritiana</span> (Kinch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). </p>  In Papua New Guinea, densities went from 12 individuals per hectare in  1992 to less than 2 individuals per hectare in 2006 (Kaly <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007), representing an 85% decline. In the Torres Strait, this species was considered overexploited and the fishery was closed in 2003, with an indication of modest recovery in 2009 (Skewes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). But the species here is still found in very low density, and a 90% decline is based on survey data in the 1980s (Conand 1989) and 2007-2008 (Purcell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>In Mozambique, high fluctuation in exports of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Holothuria scabra</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. nobilis</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. fuscogilva</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. atra</span>,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;echinites</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana</span>  may be due to irregular reporting or to overexploitation. Catch was  reported at 500 t in 1990, 700 t in 1993, 6 t in 1995, and 54 t in 1996.  In  Inhambane Province, holothurian fisheries are closed until stocks  rebuild (Bruckner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2003). In Madagascar, the level of exploitation of this species is increasing and there has been an&#160; estimated decline of 35% over 12 years for this species (Rasolofonirina pers comm. 2009). In Egypt, this species was second in abundance to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Holothuria atra</span>, however a survey four years after  the official fishing ban showed no evidence of stock recovery (Conand 2008).",Decreasing,"This species is found throughout the central Pacific and Indian Oceans.  It occurs from eastern Africa and the Red Sea in the west, to Hawaii, and the Solomon Islands in the southeast. In Madagascar, this species is observed on the west coast from the south of Toliara to Nosy-be. It is common on the west coast of Madagascar from Fort-Dauphin to Nosy-be and in the northeast coast (Antongil Bay).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga mauritiana </span>is harvested both commercially as well as in subsistence fisheries throughout its distribution. <br/><br/>In many countries of the Western Central Pacific region, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana</span>  is consumed as bêche-de-mer or their instestines and/or gonads are  consumed as delicacies or as the protein component in traditional diets.  Bêche-de-mer consumption is of greater importance in times of hardship.  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. mauritiana</span> is among the top  three species for local subsistence consumption (Kinch et al. 2008).

It is  also part of a subsistence fishery in Palau, Nauru, Wallis-Futuna,  Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia and PNG (Kinch <em>et al.</em> 2008a, b).",Marine,"<p>A 10-year moratorium on the harvest of all sea cucumbers was put in place across the CNMI in 1998. In Torres Strait (Australia), the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Actinopyga mauritiana</span> fishery was closed in 2003 due to overexploitation (Uthicke 2004). In Papua New Guinea there are restrictions in place for the harvesting of this sea cucumber such as: minimum landing size (20 cm live, 8 cm dry), a fishing season (between January 16<sup>th</sup> and September 30<sup>th</sup>), Total Allowable Catch, gear restrictions and permits for storage and export. This species has been overexploited in some areas, leading to closed fisheries (Skewes <em>et al.</em> 2004). Sea cucumber fishing has been banned in India since 2001. Sea cucumber collection has been banned in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Bruckner et al. 2003).

178341498,178290276,Pycnopodia helianthoides,Critically Endangered,A2ace,2020,2020-08-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> has experienced dramatic decreases in population size and range after enduring a global disease outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS). From 2013-2017, <em>Pycnopodia </em>and other sea star species were devastated by SSWS, which affected a variety of sea star species across more than 5,000 km of the western coast of North America (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2019; Menge <em>et al. </em>2016; Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016; Miner <em>et al.</em> 2018; Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2019; Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019). Prior to 2013, <em>Pycnopodia </em>was regularly found in a variety of shallow marine habitats from the Pacific Coast of Baja California, Mexico to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States. It is a non-harvested, generalist species and had few major threats prior to the disease outbreak.&#160;<br/><br/>After the rapid loss of <em>Pycnopodia </em>to SSWS from 2013-2017, we compiled 31 datasets including 61,043 surveys that showed that <em>Pycnopodia </em>population size declined by 90.6% from its historic to its current population size. Additionally, the area of occupancy has declined 57.6% from 4,052 km² before the outbreak (2003-2012) to 1,716 km² afterward. The species is now extremely rare across much of the outer coast of the contiguous United States and Mexico, a swath of 2500 km of coastline. Since the initial outbreak subsided around 2016-17, <em>Pycnopodia</em> populations have not begun to recover, are still declining in many regions, and have reached near-zero densities along the outer coasts of the contiguous United States and Mexico. Further, there is evidence that the disease is still present in remaining populations, and warming water from global climate change seems to contribute to disease severity.&#160;<br/><br/>The decline of this predatory sea star species may have ecosystem-wide implications. Evidence in some locales suggests that the loss of predatory <em>Pycnopodia </em>on rocky reefs can substantially reduce their predation on sea urchins, allowing urchins populations to grow and overgraze kelp. Kelp are the foundational species in kelp forest ecosystems and provide habitat and food to many organisms, including those in important fisheries (e.g. abalone, rockfish). However, it is not yet known whether the role of <em>Pycnopodia </em>as a sea urchin predator is a key driver of kelp forest health in North America or whether their role is important only under certain circumstances. In places where <em>Pycnopodia </em>does benefit kelp, the recovery of <em>Pycnopodia </em>may be a valuable management tool for maintaining healthy kelp forest ecosystems in the future.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Pycnopodia </em>meets the qualification for Critically Endangered under Criterion A2ace on the basis of its 90.6% global decline. Additionally, it qualifies for Vulnerable under Criterion B2ab as its current area of occupancy is less than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, its number of locations could be as low as 1, and there is evidence for continuing population declines. <em>Pycnopodia</em> qualifies as Least Concern under Criteria C and D, and Data Deficient under Criterion E. For further details see the Supplementary Materials.","<strong>Habitats<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>appears to be a habitat generalist, occurring on many different types of marine habitats including mud, sand, shell, gravel, rocky bottoms, kelp forests, and the lower rocky intertidal (Fisher 1928, Mauzey <em>et al.</em> 1968, Lambert 2000). Previous work on <em>Pycnopodia </em>has shown variable associations with one or another habitat types depending on life stage and region (Shivji <em>et al.</em> 1983). Our analysis of habitat preferences showed that no clear associations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>with particular habitat or substrate types in California (see Supplementary Material: Data Analysis: Depth and Habitat Patterns for more information). Because of this finding, we did not incorporate habitat type into our population estimates.&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Depths<br/></strong>Previous sources have identified the depth range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>to be from 0 - 435 m (0 - 1427 ft) and typically no more than 120 m (394 ft) (Fisher 1928, Lambert 2000, Hemery <em>et al. </em>2016). In our global analysis, we found that <em>Pycnopodia </em>was most abundant before the sea star wasting syndrome outbreak in shallow nearshore waters less than 25 m (82 ft), less abundant in middle depths 25 m to 50 m (164 ft), and present but rare to depths up to 300 m (Mean ± SD: 39,077 ± 226,556 km<sup>-2</sup>, 1,996 ± 5,573 km<sup>-2</sup>, and 204 ± 740 km<sup>-2</sup>, respectively). The large standard deviations in these averages are because <em>Pycnopodia </em>tends to be patchily distributed. <em>Pycnopodia </em>was very rare below 300 m depth, with only 12 records. The deepest record was 455 m (1493 ft), though it is possible that this and other deep records were actually misidentified <em>Rathbunaster californicus</em>, a species that looks similar and extends deeper. The upper depth range extends into the low intertidal zone to around 0 m above mean lower low water, especially along the Alaskan coast (Konar<em> et al.</em> 2019). Regarding depth preferences in shallower waters within the range of SCUBA (&lt;30 m or &lt;100 ft), no pattern in densities (Bonaviri<em> et al.</em> 2017) nor sizes (Shivji <em>et al. </em>1983) with depth have been noted in the literature. We also detected no pattern in densities within this shallower range (up to 25 m).<br/><strong><br/>Environmental Range<br/></strong>The large geographic range of this species indicates it can inhabit a wide variety of environments. Along the Oregon coast, correlations between <em>Pycnopodia </em>distributions and environmental conditions suggest that their abundances are driven most strongly by annual mean daily water temperature (peak at 9-11.5 °C), depth (peak at 0 to 75m) and annual mean daily salinity (peak at 33.0-33.4 PSU), in that order (Hemery<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160; Within the 12-16°C gradient in mean annual water temperature along the Channel Islands, California, <em>Pycnopodia </em>was more abundant at the cooler western islands (San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands) than the warmer eastern islands (Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands), and 14°C seemed to be strong cutoff driving abundance (Bonaviri <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet and Ecological Role<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>is a generalist and opportunistic predator that consumes a large number of prey taxa including but not limited to gastropods, echinoderms, and crustaceans (Supp. Fig. 6; Mauzey<em> et al. </em>1968, Herrlinger 1983, Beas-Luna <em>et al. </em>2014). <em>Pycnopodia </em>is usually considered a macroinvertivore since the bulk of its prey fit this category. Preferred prey items vary due to local abundance, climate, latitude, and habitat gradients. For example, Mytilus trossulus (formerly M. edulis) has been reported to be a favorite prey item in the Gulf of Alaska (Paul and Feder 1975), gastropods in British Columbia (Shivji<em> et al.</em> 1983), sea urchins in northern California (Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019) and gastropods and crustaceans in central California (Herrlinger 1983). Interestingly, very few species feed on <em>Pycnopodia </em>(Supp. Fig. 6; Mauzey <em>et al.</em> 1968).<br/><br/>As a generalist predator, <em>Pycnopodia </em>can regulate the structure of nearshore benthic communities and are considered a keystone predator in some areas across its distribution (Duggins 1983, Herrlinger 1983). <em>Pycnopodia </em>preys on sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. droebachiensis, and Mesocentrotus franciscanus) and can create small, urchin-free zones through direct predation or by causing sea urchin “stampedes” (Paine and Vadas 1969, Duggins 1983, Watson and Estes 2011). Since sea urchins feed on kelp (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera, and Nereocystis luetkeana) the short-term existence of prey-free patches can influence algal diversity, community primary productivity, and kelp forest community structure (Paine and Vadas 1969, Dayton 1975, Duggins 1983, Herrlinger 1983). Since the SSWS outbreak began in 2013, several papers have identified further evidence of the potential ecological role <em>Pycnopodia </em>can play in kelp forest ecosystems. The loss of this predator was associated with a 311% increase in the abundance of medium-sized urchins and a 30% decline in kelp densities in British Columbia, suggesting <em>Pycnopodia </em>exerts top-down control over urchin populations (Burt <em>et al. </em>2018). A similar phenomenon has been observed in southern British Columbia, Northern California, and southern California (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre<em> et al.</em> 2020). The potential for <em>Pycnopodia </em>to play a role in regulating kelp forest community structure and dynamics may be strongest in regions lacking other sea urchin predators, such as otters.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Life History and Reproduction<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia </em>has separate sexes and broadcast spawn to produce free-swimming, feeding, pelagic larvae (Greer 1962, Morris<em> et al.</em> 1980). The larvae develop for 50-146 days before settling and metamorphosing (Strathmann 1978, J. Hodin pers. comm. 2020). Beyond this basic information, little is understood about the reproductive ecology, growth rates, physiology, and longevity of <em>Pycnopodia</em>. They exhibit indeterminate growth and have not been individually tagged successfully nor reared in captivity from birth through adulthood, so determining lifespan and growth rates is challenging. We interviewed aquarists and larval ecologists, gathered size distribution data and used models to estimate the generation time for <em>Pycnopodia</em>. We found generation time to be in the range of 20.5 – 65 years, with the middle-most estimates providing a narrower range of 27 – 37 years range (Supp. Figs. 7 and 8 and Supp. Table 6). For more information on reproduction, life history, and generation time modeling, see Supplementary Materials: Habitats and Ecology: Life History and Ecology &amp; Determination of Generation Time.","<strong>Disease<br/></strong>Without question, disease is currently the greatest threat to <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations. This global analysis and many published works (Hewson<em> et al. </em>2014, Montecino-Latorre <em>et al. </em>2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Burt <em>et al.</em> 2018, Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2019, Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020) demonstrate that this species’ precipitous decline corresponds to the outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome in 2013-2017. Though the global outbreak appears to have subsided, localized outbreaks continue to occur in <em>Pycnopodia </em>and other sea star species. The pathogen or agent that causes SSWS remains unknown (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019). While disease is the proximate threat, there is also evidence that climate change in the form of increasing temperatures exacerbates or may have triggered the disease (see Climate Change below). It is imperative that we understand disease etiology and dynamics in coordination with any attempts to mitigate disease effects or aid <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery. For more information see Supplementary Material: Threats.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Climate Change&#160;<br/></strong>There is evidence that warmer temperatures speed the progression and increase mortality from SSWS in the laboratory (Eisenlord <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kohl <em>et al.</em> 2016). Anomalously warm water temperature has been associated with region-specific timing of SSWS outbreaks in <em>Pycnopodia </em>(Eisenlord <em>et al.</em> 2016, Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019, Aalto <em>et al.</em> 2020). Understanding the mechanistic relationship between temperature and SSWS will help to understand the continued risks for <em>Pycnopodia </em>and inform recovery efforts. For more on the interaction of climate change and SSWS threats, please see the Supplementary Material: Threats.&#160;<br/><br/>It also is likely that warming waters with global climate change may directly decrease <em>Pycnopodia </em>densities. Along the Oregon coast, Hemery <em>et al.</em> (2016) found strong effects of temperature, with peak abundances occurring at 9–11.5°C. Similarly, in Southern California warmer water temperature was associated with decreasing density of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, and 14°C seemed to be a strong cutoff driving abundance (Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overall, it is possible that ocean warming from human-caused climate change could drive decreases in <em>Pycnopodia </em>density in surviving populations or prohibit recovery.<br/><br/><strong>Fishing and Trade<br/></strong>While bycatch of <em>Pycnopodia </em>occurs in multiple fisheries (i.e. trap, seine, and trawl), more information is needed to determine whether this is a threat to <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations. Similarly, we do not know whether dried <em>Pycnopodia </em>traded by online retailers represents a threat. Finally, there are anecdotal observations that refuge populations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in the fjords of British Columbia may be disrupted by the practice of “log dumping”, where timber is felled into the fjords before transport (T. Blaine, pers. comm.). The threat this poses to these refuge populations is unknown. When population sizes of <em>Pycnopodia</em> are large, it is unlikely that any of these external sources of mortality from fishing and trade pose a substantial threat to the species. However, these activities could hinder population recovery in areas with severely reduced population sizes. Further investigation of these potential threats is needed.","<strong>Historical Abundance<br/></strong>Literature on <em>Pycnopodia</em> abundance before the 2013–2017 sea star wasting disease outbreak suggests that they were fairly common throughout their range. These include studies from Alaska, United States (Duggins 1983, Konar <em>et al.</em> 2019), British Columbia, Canada (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Burt<em> et al.</em> 2018), Oregon, United States (Hemery <em>et al.</em> 2016), and California, United States (Herrlinger 1983, Eckert 2007, Rassweiler <em>et al. </em>2010, Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020). The most geographically comprehensive study was done by Harvell <em>et al. </em>(2019) from Alaska to California. For details on each of these studies, please see the Supplementary Material: <em>Pycnopodia </em>Populations in the Literature.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>The Outbreak of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome<br/></strong>Many of the studies referenced above detail the recent declines in <em>Pycnopodia </em>populations caused by the outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) that began in 2013 (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016, Bonaviri <em>et al.</em> 2017, Burt <em>et al.</em> 2018, Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019, Konar <em>et al. </em>2019, Rogers-Bennett and Catton 2019, Eisaguirre <em>et al.</em> 2020). Harvell <em>et al. </em>(2019) showed a 100% decline in Oregon and California and a 99.2% decline in Washington due to SSWS. SSWS is the largest marine epizootic on record (Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019) and affected over 20 species of sea stars (Hewson <em>et al. </em>2014). <em>Pycnopodia </em>was especially vulnerable (Montecino-Latorre <em>et al. </em>2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016) because it was the most susceptible of the sea star taxa affected by the multi-host SSWS pathogen (Harvell <em>et al. </em>2019). SSWS was first observed in the Olympic Coast of Washington in June 2013 followed by Central California and the Salish Sea in summer 2013. It quickly expanded south to Mexico and slowly northward, arriving in the Aleutian Islands by 2016. While the cause of SSWS is unclear (Hewson <em>et al.</em> 2018), it causes lesions, arm loss, and ultimately death within days to weeks, and very few individuals recover once symptoms appear (Hewson <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/><strong>Estimating Population Sizes over Time<br/></strong>We assessed the global population of <em>Pycnopodia</em> using 31 datasets (Supp. Fig.1 and Supp. Table 1) from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska to the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. These included 61,043 surveys spanning from 1967 to 2020 and distributed from the rocky intertidal to the bathyal plain at 984m deep. Since the <em>Pycnopodia </em>decline followed an abrupt non-linear pattern (Supp. Fig. 2), we elected to compare the population decline before versus after sea star wasting syndrome (see Supplementary Material for more detail on this timeline). To estimate global population trends (Supp. Fig. 3), we first the estimated seafloor surface area among regions and depths to quantify available habitat (Supp. Tables 2 and 3). We then determined how densities (1987-2019) of <em>Pycnopodia </em>varied by region, depth, and outbreak phase (Supp. Fig. 4 and Supp.&#160; Tables 2 and 5). We then multiplied density by habitat area to calculate the estimated population size before and after the SSWS outbreak (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). For further details on these methods, please refer to Supplementary Material: Population Data and Methods for IUCN Assessment.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Global Decline<br/></strong>Our global analysis confirms the declines caused by sea star wasting syndrome documented in many of the studies above. Indeed, many of the datasets in the references above were included in our global analyses. We calculated a 90.6% global decline in <em>Pycnopodia </em>population size when comparing before (1987-2013) to after (2014, 2015 or 2017-2019, depending on the region) the SSWS outbreak (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). The decline extended to all depths, with a 92.9% decline in deep depths (&gt;25m) and a 93.8% decline in shallow depths (&lt;25m) (Supp. Table 2). The global post-decline population estimate is 594,251,528 (average between 2014/2015/2017 and 2019, depending on timing of the decline in each region). However, the global estimate for 2019 is 80,627,721.<br/><br/><strong>Region-Specific Declines&#160;<br/></strong>Among regions in shallow waters (where the vast majority of animals are found), the most severe declines occurred in the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the outer coast of the western continental United States, where the decline ranged from 97.2% - 99.8% (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). Severe declines also occurred in many northern regions, including a 91.9% decline in the Salish Sea, a 94.7% decline in southeast Alaska, and a 94.9% decline in the eastern Gulf of Alaska.<br/><br/>The western Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands showed more moderate population declines (61.1% decline, Supp. Table 2), and observations by contributors suggest the disease was less severe in these regions (B. Konar, pers. comm. 2020). However, sparse observations make these estimates uncertain (Supp. Table 2; N = 7 surveys after the SSWS-induced decline). We present two estimates of decline for the north, central and coastal British Columbian coast. The first compares before and after the Aug 1 2015 pre-/post-crash cutoff (matches analysis use for other regions) and indicates a moderate decline (67.4%). However, we believe this number is an underestimate because it incorporates the data from juvenile animals that recruited to Calvert Island, British Columbia shortly after SSWS. This population then experienced a second decline in 2018, presumably due to another SSWS outbreak, and most did not reach adult size (A. Gehman pers. obs. 2020). We were not able to separate these juveniles from adults, so we narrowed our post-decline population estimate using data from 2018-2019 only, when the second outbreak had subsided and the remaining animals were generally nearing adult size. Using this method, we estimated that the decline in this region was 89.9% (Supp. Table 2).<br/><br/><strong>Continued Declines<br/></strong>The remaining populations are primarily in the northern half of the species’ previous range and are patchily-distributed populations in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska, north, central and coastal British Columbia, and the Salish Sea (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2). Very few animals remain along the outer coast of the United States and Mexico (Supp. Fig. 3 and Supp. Table 2).&#160;Importantly, there is little indication that <em>Pycnopodia </em>is in the process of recovering from the outbreak (Supp. Fig. 5 and Supp. Table 4). Indeed, most regions with remaining populations, including much of Alaska and British Columbia (including the Salish Sea), have exhibited continuing declines since 2017. Regions on the outer coast of the contiguous United States and Mexico, have “flat lined” at extremely low densities (Supp. Fig. 5; Washington outer coast, Oregon, North, Central, Southern and Baja California). <em>Pycnopodia </em>is now very rare along this &gt; 2500 km stretch of coastline, and seem to be decreasing. Notably, in all of the United States and Mexican contiguous outer coast, only 20 of 3976 total surveys recorded an animal between 2018-2019, with only 7 in California, and most of these were lone individuals. No animals have been recorded in Baja California since 2015, and none in California in 2019 (Supp. Table 4).",Decreasing,"<strong>Range Description<br/></strong><em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> is commonly found in marine waters ranging from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States to San Diego, California, United States (Herrlinger 1983). However, this global analysis shows that the historical southern limit of <em>Pycnopodia </em>extends to Isla Natividad, Baja California, Mexico (27.84501°N, 115.1428°W). From there, it used to be common northward throughout the Pacific coastline of North America. Our northernmost observation is in Bettles Bay near Anchorage Alaska, United States (60.95496°N, 148.29942°W). From our data, it also extends westward along the Aleutian Island chain to the Fox Islands near Nikolski, Alaska (52.63844°N, 169.1337°W), and researchers have observed it as far west as Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, in the Andreanof Islands in 2006 (S. Jewett pers. comm. 2020). Other than a single, and perhaps misidentified, observation near St. George Island, Alaska (56.67678°N, 169.5519°W), the species does not appear to extend into the Bering Sea.<br/><br/><strong>Depth Range<br/></strong>Our analysis and historical records show that the depth range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>is from 0 to 455 m (0–1,493 ft) with the highest abundance between 0 and 25 m deep. They are rare deeper than 120 m (394 ft) (Fisher 1928, Lambert 2000, Hemery <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Number of Locations<br/></strong>The primary threat to <em>Pycnopodia</em> is sea star wasting syndrome, which appears to have caused declines in all populations globally within three years. Thus, the minimum number of locations (defined by IUCN as a geographically or ecologically distinct area in which a single threatening process can rapidly affect all occurrences of an ecosystem type) could be as low as 1. However, considering the species’ broad geographic range and the finding that populations in the northwestern edge of its range may have been less affected by the disease, the number of locations may be as high as 10.","No targeted fisheries exist for <em>Pycnopodia</em>. Although most regions allow recreational harvest of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, the harvest rate is likely extremely low. However, <em>Pycnopodia </em>is routinely encountered as bycatch in bottom-contacted pot and trap fisheries as well as trawl and seine fisheries (Supp. Figs. 9 and 10). The encounter rate and survival rate as bycatch is unclear. They are difficult to disentangle without injury, so handling may decrease survival. There is no evidence that this species is widely traded as a live animal in the aquarium trade. Their large size and predatory behavior probably deter nearly all aquarists. Although not pervasive, dried “sunflower sea stars” are commercially sold individually online as decor. For details, see the Supplementary Material: Use and Trade.",Marine,"<strong>Determining the Cause of SSWS<br/></strong>The cause of SSWS is an essential question that should be answered before we can determine the advisability of <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery efforts. The persistence of SSWS, especially in other species, may potentially negate or greatly reduce the efficacy of any <em>Pycnopodia </em>captive rearing and reintroduction efforts outlined below. Further, we have no diagnostic test for SSWS to ensure that sea stars that we may introduce to the wild are not a danger to wild <em>Pycnopodia </em>or to other sea stars.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Captive Rearing and Reintroduction<br/></strong>Captive rearing is the most viable recovery option for locales with few or no <em>Pycnopodia </em>that are far from surviving populations (i.e. the outer Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico). While this conservation action does not address the underlying threats to <em>Pycnopodia </em>(disease and climate change), it can be used to restore populations in suitable areas that may not otherwise recover on their own. Drawing from aquaculture practices, captive rearing of <em>Pycnopodia </em>has the potential for cost-effective high production on a relatively quick timescale. Captive rearing efforts could provide a reservoir of individuals to maintain genetic diversity, maintain population numbers, and aid in the recovery of the species. Further, captive rearing programs can have the simultaneous benefit of being scientific resources to study SSWS and to gather information on the life history and environmental niche of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, which could aid subsequent recovery efforts. To this end, the Nature Conservancy and the University of Washington have collaborated to begin the captive rearing of <em>Pycnopodia</em>, have demonstrated its feasibility, and have accumulated valuable life history information (e.g., growth rates, environmental conditions, diets) that will inform future conservation actions.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reducing Lethal Take<br/></strong>While we assume direct harvest is relatively low (see Use and Trade), even a small amount of take in this critically endangered species can hinder recovery. Currently, there are few protections against harvest of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in most regions and we have little information on harvest statistics. Enacting specific regulations that disallow the targeted harvest of <em>Pycnopodia </em>could reduce this source of mortality, which could be particularly important for small, remnant populations.<br/><br/>Reducing bycatch, particularly in trap fisheries, is an additional potential conservation action to aid recovery of <em>Pycnopodia</em>. Since the threat posed by bycatch to <em>Pycnopodia </em>is unclear (see Use and Trade and Threats), the first conservation action should be to determine its magnitude. If bycatch indeed can cause decline or hinder recovery (particularly in vulnerable populations), public engagement with the recreational and commercial fleets about best practices for catch and release would be a logical next step.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Localized Protections<br/></strong>The recovery of isolated or sparse populations of adult <em>Pycnopodia </em>or the success of new recruitment events may also benefit from locally focused protection from take or disturbance. For example, one of the few surviving populations of <em>Pycnopodia </em>in the contiguous United States occurs in Hood Canal, Washington, where bycatch from the local crab fishery could have a negative impact on persistence or recovery. Similarly, there are surviving populations in the fjords of Central British Columbia (T. Blaine pers. comm. 2020) where the practice of&#160; “log dumping” (felling or storing trees in the marine environment for later transport), could have detrimental effects on those populations. Some localized, and perhaps temporary, protections against human activity for these survivors may aid local recovery. Further, there is modest evidence that juvenile <em>Pycnopodia </em>utilize nearshore seagrass beds as a nursery habitat (A. Gehman and M. Miner pers. obs. 2020). Seagrass beds are highly susceptible to habitat degradation (Orth <em>et al.</em> 2006) so protecting these habitats may aid <em>Pycnopodia </em>recovery. Finally, the recovery of this species in severely affected areas is contingent on recruitment from remote source populations. Since recruitment of <em>Pycnopodia </em>is often episodic and mortality of juveniles quite high (Sewell and Watson 1993), the success of a recruitment event may hinge on the local rates of mortality from human activities like fishing and habitat destruction.&#160;<br/><br/>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) may also serve as a viable, but less targeted, conservation action. While the spatially explicit protection afforded by MPAs does not necessarily protect <em>Pycnopodia </em>from its two most important threats, SSWS and climate change, MPAs can mitigate harvest, pollution, and habitat degradation. Multiple MPAs already exist in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and comprise ~1.55% of the range of <em>Pycnopodia </em>(5,377,374 km<sup>2</sup>; see Supplemental Material: Conservation Actions for details on these MPAs). These MPAs could also serve as target areas for the restoration and re-establishment of <em>Pycnopodia </em>by affording space-based protections during recovery. (see Supplemental Material: Conservation Actions and https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UM662HazRfvtnCrXdUJAszUn6jv0Ok-Yj5XiHETU30/edit?usp=sharing for details on these MPAs).","",,false,false,Global
