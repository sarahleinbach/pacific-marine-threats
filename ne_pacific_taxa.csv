Based on the fossil record, Kurtén (1964) recommended the Phipps (1774) name <em>Ursus maritimus,</em> which was promoted by Harington (1966), Manning (1971) and Wilson (1976) and is used today (see DeMaster and Stirling 1981, Amstrup 2003, Wilson and Reeder 2005).</p>"

Although earlier work had suggested that more than a single species or subspecies might exist, the current belief is that there is only the one species (Rice 1998) and genetic studies suggest that they are panmictic (Dickerson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Despite the genetic history that indicates mixing, there are currently two recognized stocks of Northern Fur Seals in North America. The Eastern Pacific stock includes those Fur Seals breeding on the three primary rookeries in Alaska, the Pribilof Islands and Bogoslof Island in the Aleutian chain. The San Miguel stock includes those seals breeding on the Channel Islands and the Farallon Islands of California."
15106,Odobenus rosmarus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARNIVORA,MAMMALIA,ODOBENIDAE,Odobenus,rosmarus,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","The Walrus, <em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>, was in the past divided into three subspecies: the Atlantic Walrus (<em>O. r. rosmarus</em>), the Pacific Walrus (<em>O. r. divergens</em>), and the Laptev Walrus (<em>O. r. laptevi</em>) (Rice 1998). However, the status of the Laptev Walrus has always been somewhat uncertain, animals from that region are described as being intermediate in size between the Pacific and Atlantic forms, with skull morphology most similar to the Pacific subspecies (Fay 1982). Recent analyses of mitochondrial DNA and morphometric data suggest that the taxon <em>O. r. laptevi</em> should be abandoned (Lindqvist <em>et al.</em> 2009). The walruses found in the Laptev Sea are in all probability the westernmost part of the Pacific Walrus population.<br/><br/>The IUCN Pinniped Specialist Group has assessed the status of the Atlantic and Pacific Walrus subspecies separately. This assessment combines those two analyses to assess the global status of the Walrus as a species."
2477,Balaenoptera musculus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,BALAENOPTERIDAE,Balaenoptera,musculus,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","The Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (Committee on Taxonomy 2016) provisionally lists the following subspecies: <em>Balaenoptera musculus musculus</em> (Linnaeus, 1758) - Northern Blue Whale (found in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific); <em>B. m. intermedia</em> (Burmeister, 1871) - Antarctic Blue Whale;<em> B. m. indica</em> (Blyth 1859) - Northern Indian Ocean Blue Whale; <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> (Ichihara, 1966) - Pygmy Blue Whale; and <em>B. m. un-named </em>subspecies - Chilean Blue Whale.<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies <em>B. m. musculus</em> refers at least to the North Atlantic Blue Whale which was the basis for the first description of the species by Linnaeus. Animals in the North Pacific are similar in size and morphology to North Atlantic Blue Whales and are also regarded as<em> B. m. musculus</em>, pending a genetic comparison of these populations. The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em> is distinguished by its large body size and Antarctic distribution in summer. The Pygmy Blue Whale <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has a number of morphological characteristics that distinguish it from <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and <em>B. m. musculus</em>. It occurs in the Indian Ocean, excluding the Antarctic, from Africa and Madagascar across to Indonesia and Australia, and in the southwestern Pacific, including Tasmania and New Zealand. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean have been tentatively assigned the name<em> B. m. indica</em>, but a clear distinction between <em>B. m. indica </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has not yet been established.<br/><br/>Blue Whales in the southeastern Pacific are intermediate in size between <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and<em> B. m. brevicauda</em> (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and are genetically differentiated from both groups (LeDuc<em> et al.</em> 2017). They are provisionally designated as an unnamed subspecies with the common name Chilean Blue Whales. Chilean Blue Whales are genetically most similar to Blue Whales in the northeast Pacific (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2017); investigations into the genetic and morphological distinction between these two groups are ongoing. The respective winter ranges of Blue Whales from the eastern South Pacific (Chilean Blue whales) and from the eastern North Pacific may overlap in the eastern equatorial Pacific but their breeding seasons are probably six months out of phase (LeDuc<em> et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><u>UAE Taxonomic Note</u><br/>Several subspecies have been reported. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean are believed to be Pygmy Blue whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda</em> Ichihara, 1966), but may include a distinct population assigned to <em>Balaenoptera musculus indica </em>(Blyth, 1859), although Mikhalev (1996) regarded them as Pygmy Blue Whales and not significantly different from Pygmy Blue Whales in the southern Indian Ocean (Reilly <em>et al.</em> 2008a)."

However, Archer <em>et al</em>. (2013) proposed on genetic grounds that Fin Whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific should be considered separate subspecies. There are few records of <em>B. p. patachonica</em> and the type specimen is currently (May 2018) awaiting genetic analysis. In older accounts, the common name Fin Whale, and its equivalent in other languages, tended to be used for any whales of the genus <em>Balaenoptera.</em><br/></p>"

While not all cetologists accept that the three Right Whale taxa qualify as full biological species, their clear geographical separation ensures that their treatment as separate taxa for conservation purposes is appropriate.</span>"

The Society for Marine Mammalogy’s Committee on Taxonomy (Committee on Taxonomy 2017) recognizes two subspecies, <em>B. b. borealis</em> in the Northern Hemisphere and <em>B. b. schlegelii</em> in the Southern Hemisphere, as proposed by Tomilin (1957). The Sei Whales found in the North Pacific and North Atlantic have not been formally compared and so are still placed in the same nominate subspecies by default, although Huijser <em>et al</em>.
