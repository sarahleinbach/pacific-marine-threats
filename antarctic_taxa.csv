41755,Physeter macrocephalus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,PHYSETERIDAE,Physeter,macrocephalus,,,,,"Linnaeus, 1758","Although <em>Physeter catodon</em> is still occasionally used in the literature, <em>P</em>.<em> macrocephalus</em> is recommended (Rice 1989). Both names are listed on the same page of the original description by Linnaeus (1758), and priority is unclear. However, <em>P</em>. <em>macrocephalu</em>s is preferable because it is used much more frequently, and this will support nomenclatural stability."
2477,Balaenoptera musculus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,BALAENOPTERIDAE,Balaenoptera,musculus,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","The Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (Committee on Taxonomy 2016) provisionally lists the following subspecies: <em>Balaenoptera musculus musculus</em> (Linnaeus, 1758) - Northern Blue Whale (found in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific); <em>B. m. intermedia</em> (Burmeister, 1871) - Antarctic Blue Whale;<em> B. m. indica</em> (Blyth 1859) - Northern Indian Ocean Blue Whale; <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> (Ichihara, 1966) - Pygmy Blue Whale; and <em>B. m. un-named </em>subspecies - Chilean Blue Whale.<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies <em>B. m. musculus</em> refers at least to the North Atlantic Blue Whale which was the basis for the first description of the species by Linnaeus. Animals in the North Pacific are similar in size and morphology to North Atlantic Blue Whales and are also regarded as<em> B. m. musculus</em>, pending a genetic comparison of these populations. The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em> is distinguished by its large body size and Antarctic distribution in summer. The Pygmy Blue Whale <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has a number of morphological characteristics that distinguish it from <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and <em>B. m. musculus</em>. It occurs in the Indian Ocean, excluding the Antarctic, from Africa and Madagascar across to Indonesia and Australia, and in the southwestern Pacific, including Tasmania and New Zealand. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean have been tentatively assigned the name<em> B. m. indica</em>, but a clear distinction between <em>B. m. indica </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has not yet been established.<br/><br/>Blue Whales in the southeastern Pacific are intermediate in size between <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and<em> B. m. brevicauda</em> (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and are genetically differentiated from both groups (LeDuc<em> et al.</em> 2017). They are provisionally designated as an unnamed subspecies with the common name Chilean Blue Whales. Chilean Blue Whales are genetically most similar to Blue Whales in the northeast Pacific (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2017); investigations into the genetic and morphological distinction between these two groups are ongoing. The respective winter ranges of Blue Whales from the eastern South Pacific (Chilean Blue whales) and from the eastern North Pacific may overlap in the eastern equatorial Pacific but their breeding seasons are probably six months out of phase (LeDuc<em> et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><u>UAE Taxonomic Note</u><br/>Several subspecies have been reported. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean are believed to be Pygmy Blue whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda</em> Ichihara, 1966), but may include a distinct population assigned to <em>Balaenoptera musculus indica </em>(Blyth, 1859), although Mikhalev (1996) regarded them as Pygmy Blue Whales and not significantly different from Pygmy Blue Whales in the southern Indian Ocean (Reilly <em>et al.</em> 2008a)."
2478,Balaenoptera physalus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,BALAENOPTERIDAE,Balaenoptera,physalus,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","<p>The Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy provisionally recognizes three subspecies: the Northern Fin Whale,&#160;<em>Balaenoptera physalus physalus,</em> (Linnaeus, 1758); the Southern Fin Whale,&#160;<em>B. p. quoyi</em> (Fischer, 1829), which is larger than <em>B. p. physalus,</em> and the Pygmy Fin Whale,&#160;<em>B. p. patachonica </em>(Burmeister, 1865), proposed by Clark (2004), which is smaller than <em>B. p. quoyi</em> and has dark baleen (Committee on Taxonomy 2018). However, Archer <em>et al</em>. (2013) proposed on genetic grounds that Fin Whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific should be considered separate subspecies. There are few records of <em>B. p. patachonica</em> and the type specimen is currently (May 2018) awaiting genetic analysis. In older accounts, the common name Fin Whale, and its equivalent in other languages, tended to be used for any whales of the genus <em>Balaenoptera.</em><br/></p>"
2475,Balaenoptera borealis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,BALAENOPTERIDAE,Balaenoptera,borealis,,,,,"Lesson, 1828","<p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>The Sei Whale, <em>Balaenoptera borealis</em> is a recognized species but catch and sightings records of Sei Whales prior to 1972 tended to include Bryde's Whales (<em>B. edeni </em><em>or</em><em> B. brydei</em>) in areas where both species occur. The Society for Marine Mammalogyâ€™s Committee on Taxonomy (Committee on Taxonomy 2017) recognizes two subspecies, <em>B. b. borealis</em> in the Northern Hemisphere and <em>B. b. schlegelii</em> in the Southern Hemisphere, as proposed by Tomilin (1957). The Sei Whales found in the North Pacific and North Atlantic have not been formally compared and so are still placed in the same nominate subspecies by default, although Huijser <em>et al</em>. (2018) found a high degree of genetic divergence between North Atlantic and North Pacific Sei Whales.</span></p><p>  </p><p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>"
